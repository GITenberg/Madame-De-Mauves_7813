    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The view from the terrace at Saint-Germain-en-Laye is immense and famous.
      Paris lies spread before you in dusky vastness, domed and fortified,
      glittering here and there through her light vapours and girdled with her
      silver Seine. Behind you is a park of stately symmetry, and behind that a
      forest where you may lounge through turfy avenues and light-chequered
      glades and quite forget that you are within half an hour of the
      boulevards. One afternoon, however, in mid-spring, some five years ago, a
      young man seated on the terrace had preferred to keep this in mind. His
      eyes were fixed in idle wistfulness on the mighty human hive before him.
      He was fond of rural things, and he had come to Saint-Germain a week
      before to meet the spring halfway; but though he could boast of a six
      months&rsquo; acquaintance with the great city he never looked at it from his
      present vantage without a sense of curiosity still unappeased. There were
      moments when it seemed to him that not to be there just then was to miss
      some thrilling chapter of experience. And yet his winter&rsquo;s experience had
      been rather fruitless and he had closed the book almost with a yawn.
      Though not in the least a cynic he was what one may call a disappointed
      observer, and he never chose the right-hand road without beginning to
      suspect after an hour&rsquo;s wayfaring that the left would have been the
      better. He now had a dozen minds to go to Paris for the evening, to dine
      at the Cafe Brebant and repair afterwards to the Gymnase and listen to the
      latest exposition of the duties of the injured husband. He would probably
      have risen to execute this project if he had not noticed a little girl
      who, wandering along the terrace, had suddenly stopped short and begun to
      gaze at him with round-eyed frankness. For a moment he was simply amused,
      the child&rsquo;s face denoting such helpless wonderment; the next he was
      agreeably surprised. &ldquo;Why this is my friend Maggie,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I see
      you&rsquo;ve not forgotten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie, after a short parley, was induced to seal her remembrance with a
      kiss. Invited then to explain her appearance at Saint-Germain, she
      embarked on a recital in which the general, according to the infantine
      method, was so fatally sacrificed to the particular that Longmore looked
      about him for a superior source of information. He found it in Maggie&rsquo;s
      mamma, who was seated with another lady at the opposite end of the
      terrace; so, taking the child by the hand, he led her back to her
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggie&rsquo;s mamma was a young American lady, as you would immediately have
      perceived, with a pretty and friendly face and a great elegance of fresh
      finery. She greeted Longmore with amazement and joy, mentioning his name
      to her friend and bidding him bring a chair and sit with them. The other
      lady, in whom, though she was equally young and perhaps even prettier,
      muslins and laces and feathers were less of a feature, remained silent,
      stroking the hair of the little girl, whom she had drawn against her knee.
      She had never heard of Longmore, but she now took in that her companion
      had crossed the ocean with him, had met him afterwards in travelling and&mdash;having
      left her husband in Wall Street&mdash;was indebted to him for sundry
      services. Maggie&rsquo;s mamma turned from time to time and smiled at this lady
      with an air of invitation; the latter smiled back and continued gracefully
      to say nothing. For ten minutes, meanwhile, Longmore felt a revival of
      interest in his old acquaintance; then (as mild riddles are more amusing
      than mere commonplaces) it gave way to curiosity about her friend. His
      eyes wandered; her volubility shook a sort of sweetness out of the
      friend&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was perhaps not obviously a beauty nor obviously an American,
      but essentially both for the really seeing eye. She was slight and fair
      and, though naturally pale, was delicately flushed just now, as by the
      effect of late agitation. What chiefly struck Longmore in her face was the
      union of a pair of beautifully gentle, almost languid grey eyes with a
      mouth that was all expression and intention. Her forehead was a trifle
      more expansive than belongs to classic types, and her thick brown hair
      dressed out of the fashion, just then even more ugly than usual. Her
      throat and bust were slender, but all the more in harmony with certain
      rapid charming movements of the head, which she had a way of throwing back
      every now and then with an air of attention and a sidelong glance from her
      dove-like eyes. She seemed at once alert and indifferent, contemplative
      and restless, and Longmore very soon discovered that if she was not a
      brilliant beauty she was at least a most attaching one. This very
      impression made him magnanimous. He was certain he had interrupted a
      confidential conversation, and judged it discreet to withdraw, having
      first learned from Maggie&rsquo;s mamma&mdash;Mrs. Draper&mdash;that she was to
      take the six o&rsquo;clock train back to Paris. He promised to meet her at the
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his appointment, and Mrs. Draper arrived betimes, accompanied by
      her friend. The latter, however, made her farewells at the door and drove
      away again, giving Longmore time only to raise his hat. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he
      asked with visible ardour as he brought the traveller her tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see me to-morrow at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Empire,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and
      I&rsquo;ll tell you all about her.&rdquo; The force of this offer in making him
      punctual at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Empire Longmore doubtless never exactly
      measured; and it was perhaps well he was vague, for he found his friend,
      who was on the point of leaving Paris, so distracted by procrastinating
      milliners and perjured lingeres that coherence had quite deserted her.
      &ldquo;You must find Saint-Germain dreadfully dull,&rdquo; she nevertheless had the
      presence of mind to say as he was going. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you come with me to
      London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce me to Madame de Mauves,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and Saint-Germain will
      quite satisfy me.&rdquo; All he had learned was the lady&rsquo;s name and residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah she, poor woman, won&rsquo;t make your affair a carnival. She&rsquo;s very
      unhappy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore&rsquo;s further enquiries were arrested by the arrival of a young lady
      with a bandbox; but he went away with the promise of a note of
      introduction, to be immediately dispatched to him at Saint-Germain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then waited a week, but the note never came, and he felt how little it
      was for Mrs. Draper to complain of engagements unperformed. He lounged on
      the terrace and walked in the forest, studied suburban street life and
      made a languid attempt to investigate the records of the court of the
      exiled Stuarts; but he spent most of his time in wondering where Madame de
      Mauves lived and whether she ever walked on the terrace. Sometimes, he was
      at last able to recognise; for one afternoon toward dusk he made her out
      from a distance, arrested there alone and leaning against the low wall. In
      his momentary hesitation to approach her there was almost a shade of
      trepidation, but his curiosity was not chilled by such a measure of the
      effect of a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s acquaintance. She at once recovered their
      connexion, on his drawing near, and showed it with the frankness of a
      person unprovided with a great choice of contacts. Her dress, her
      expression, were the same as before; her charm came out like that of fine
      music on a second hearing. She soon made conversation easy by asking him
      for news of Mrs. Draper. Longmore told her that he was daily expecting
      news and after a pause mentioned the promised note of introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems less necessary now,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;for me at least. But for you&mdash;I
      should have liked you to know the good things our friend would probably
      have been able to say about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it arrives at last,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you must come and see me and bring
      it. If it doesn&rsquo;t you must come without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she continued to linger through the thickening twilight, she
      explained that she was waiting for her husband, who was to arrive in the
      train from Paris and who often passed along the terrace on his way home.
      Longmore well remembered that Mrs. Draper had spoken of uneasy things in
      her life, and he found it natural to guess that this same husband was the
      source of them. Edified by his six months in Paris, &ldquo;What else is
      possible,&rdquo; he put it, &ldquo;for a sweet American girl who marries an unholy
      foreigner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this quiet dependence on her lord&rsquo;s return rather shook his
      shrewdness, and it received a further check from the free confidence with
      which she turned to greet an approaching figure. Longmore distinguished in
      the fading light a stoutish gentleman, on the fair side of forty, in a
      high grey hat, whose countenance, obscure as yet against the quarter from
      which it came, mainly presented to view the large outward twist of its
      moustache. M. de Mauves saluted his wife with punctilious gallantry and,
      having bowed to Longmore, asked her several questions in French. Before
      taking his offered arm to walk to their carriage, which was in waiting at
      the gate of the terrace, she introduced our hero as a friend of Mrs.
      Draper and also a fellow countryman, whom she hoped they might have the
      pleasure of seeing, as she said, chez eux. M. de Mauves responded briefly,
      but civilly, in fair English, and led his wife away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore watched him as he went, renewing the curl of his main facial
      feature&mdash;watched him with an irritation devoid of any mentionable
      ground. His one pretext for gnashing his teeth would have been in his
      apprehension that this gentleman&rsquo;s worst English might prove a matter to
      shame his own best French. For reasons involved apparently in the very
      structure of his being Longmore found a colloquial use of that idiom as
      insecure as the back of a restive horse, and was obliged to take his
      exercise, as he was aware, with more tension than grace. He reflected
      meanwhile with comfort that Madame de Mauves and he had a common tongue,
      and his anxiety yielded to his relief at finding on his table that evening
      a letter from Mrs. Draper. It enclosed a short formal missive to Madame de
      Mauves, but the epistle itself was copious and confidential. She had
      deferred writing till she reached London, where for a week, of course, she
      had found other amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the sight of so many women here who don&rsquo;t look at all like
      her that has reminded me by the law of contraries of my charming friend at
      Saint-Germain and my promise to introduce you to her,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I
      believe I spoke to you of her rather blighted state, and I wondered
      afterwards whether I hadn&rsquo;t been guilty of a breach of confidence. But you
      would certainly have arrived at guesses of your own, and, besides, she has
      never told me her secrets. The only one she ever pretended to was that
      she&rsquo;s the happiest creature in the world, after assuring me of which, poor
      thing, she went off into tears; so that I prayed to be delivered from such
      happiness. It&rsquo;s the miserable story of an American girl born neither to
      submit basely nor to rebel crookedly marrying a shining sinful Frenchman
      who believes a woman must do one or the other of those things. The
      lightest of US have a ballast that they can&rsquo;t imagine, and the poorest a
      moral imagination that they don&rsquo;t require. She was romantic and perverse&mdash;she
      thought the world she had been brought up in too vulgar or at least too
      prosaic. To have a decent home-life isn&rsquo;t perhaps the greatest of
      adventures; but I think she wishes nowadays she hadn&rsquo;t gone in quite so
      desperately for thrills. M. de Mauves cared of course for nothing but her
      money, which he&rsquo;s spending royally on his menus plaisirs. I hope you
      appreciate the compliment I pay you when I recommend you to go and cheer
      up a lady domestically dejected. Believe me, I&rsquo;ve given no other man a
      proof of this esteem; so if you were to take me in an inferior sense I
      would never speak to you again. Prove to this fine sore creature that our
      manners may have all the grace without wanting to make such selfish terms
      for it. She avoids society and lives quite alone, seeing no one but a
      horrible French sister-in-law. Do let me hear that you&rsquo;ve made her
      patience a little less absent-minded. Make her WANT to forget; make her
      like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ingenious appeal left the young man uneasy. He found himself in
      presence of more complications than had been in his reckoning. To call on
      Madame de Mauves with his present knowledge struck him as akin to fishing
      in troubled waters. He was of modest composition, and yet he asked himself
      whether an appearance of attentions from any gallant gentleman mightn&rsquo;t
      give another twist to her tangle. A flattering sense of unwonted
      opportunity, however&mdash;of such a possible value constituted for him as
      he had never before been invited to rise to&mdash;made him with the lapse
      of time more confident, possibly more reckless. It was too inspiring not
      to act upon the idea of kindling a truer light in his fair countrywoman&rsquo;s
      slow smile, and at least he hoped to persuade her that even a raw
      representative of the social order she had not done justice to was not
      necessarily a mere fortuitous collocation of atoms. He immediately called
      on her.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had been placed for her education, fourteen years before, in a
      Parisian convent, by a widowed mammma who was fonder of Homburg and Nice
      than of letting out tucks in the frocks of a vigorously growing daughter.
      Here, besides various elegant accomplishments&mdash;the art of wearing a
      train, of composing a bouquet, of presenting a cup of tea&mdash;she
      acquired a certain turn of the imagination which might have passed for a
      sign of precocious worldliness. She dreamed of marrying a man of
      hierarchical &ldquo;rank&rdquo;&mdash;not for the pleasure of hearing herself called
      Madame la Vicomtesse, for which it seemed to her she should never greatly
      care, but because she had a romantic belief that the enjoyment of
      inherited and transmitted consideration, consideration attached to the
      fact of birth, would be the direct guarantee of an ideal delicacy of
      feeling. She supposed it would be found that the state of being noble does
      actually enforce the famous obligation. Romances are rarely worked out in
      such transcendent good faith, and Euphemia&rsquo;s excuse was the prime purity
      of her moral vision. She was essentially incorruptible, and she took this
      pernicious conceit to her bosom very much as if it had been a dogma
      revealed by a white-winged angel. Even after experience had given her a
      hundred rude hints she found it easier to believe in fables, when they had
      a certain nobleness of meaning, than in well-attested but sordid facts.
      She believed that a gentleman with a long pedigree must be of necessity a
      very fine fellow, and enjoyment of a chance to carry further a family
      chronicle begun ever so far back must be, as a consciousness, a source of
      the most beautiful impulses. It wasn&rsquo;t therefore only that noblesse
      oblige, she thought, as regards yourself, but that it ensures as nothing
      else does in respect to your wife. She had never, at the start, spoken to
      a nobleman in her life, and these convictions were but a matter of
      extravagant theory. They were the fruit, in part, of the perusal of
      various Ultramontane works of fiction&mdash;the only ones admitted to the
      convent library&mdash;in which the hero was always a Legitimist vicomte
      who fought duels by the dozen but went twice a month to confession; and in
      part of the strong social scent of the gossip of her companions, many of
      them filles de haut lieu who, in the convent-garden, after Sundays at
      home, depicted their brothers and cousins as Prince Charmings and young
      Paladins. Euphemia listened and said nothing; she shrouded her visions of
      matrimony under a coronet in the silence that mostly surrounds all
      ecstatic faith. She was not of that type of young lady who is easily
      induced to declare that her husband must be six feet high and a little
      near-sighted, part his hair in the middle and have amber lights in his
      beard. To her companions her flights of fancy seemed short, rather, and
      poor and untutored; and even the fact that she was a sprig of the
      transatlantic democracy never sufficiently explained her apathy on social
      questions. She had a mental image of that son of the Crusaders who was to
      suffer her to adore him, but like many an artist who has produced a
      masterpiece of idealisation she shrank from exposing it to public
      criticism. It was the portrait of a gentleman rather ugly than handsome
      and rather poor than rich. But his ugliness was to be nobly expressive and
      his poverty delicately proud. She had a fortune of her own which, at the
      proper time, after fixing on her in eloquent silence those fine eyes that
      were to soften the feudal severity of his visage, he was to accept with a
      world of stifled protestations. One condition alone she was to make&mdash;that
      he should have &ldquo;race&rdquo; in a state as documented as it was possible to have
      it. On this she would stake her happiness; and it was so to happen that
      several accidents conspired to give convincing colour to this artless
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inclined to long pauses and slow approaches herself, Euphemia was a great
      sitter at the feet of breathless volubility, and there were moments when
      she fairly hung upon the lips of Mademoiselle Marie de Mauves. Her
      intimacy with this chosen schoolmate was founded on the perception&mdash;all
      her own&mdash;that their differences were just the right ones.
      Mademoiselle de Mauves was very positive, very shrewd, very ironical, very
      French&mdash;everything that Euphemia felt herself unpardonable for not
      being. During her Sundays en ville she had examined the world and judged
      it, and she imparted her impressions to our attentive heroine with an
      agreeable mixture of enthusiasm and scepticism. She was moreover a
      handsome and well-grown person, on whom Euphemia&rsquo;s ribbons and trinkets
      had a trick of looking better than on their slender proprietress. She had
      finally the supreme merit of being a rigorous example of the virtue of
      exalted birth, having, as she did, ancestors honourably mentioned by
      Joinville and Commines, and a stately grandmother with a hooked nose who
      came up with her after the holidays from a veritable castel in Auvergne.
      It seemed to our own young woman that these attributes made her friend
      more at home in the world than if she had been the daughter of even the
      most prosperous grocer. A certain aristocratic impudence Mademoiselle de
      Mauves abundantly possessed, and her raids among her friend&rsquo;s finery were
      quite in the spirit of her baronial ancestors in the twelfth century&mdash;a
      spirit regarded by Euphemia but as a large way of understanding
      friendship, a freedom from conformities without style, and one that would
      sooner or later express itself in acts of surprising magnanimity. There
      doubtless prevailed in the breast of Mademoiselle de Mauves herself a
      dimmer vision of the large securities that Euphemia envied her. She was to
      become later in life so accomplished a schemer that her sense of having
      further heights to scale might well have waked up early. The especially
      fine appearance made by our heroine&rsquo;s ribbons and trinkets as her friend
      wore them ministered to pleasure on both sides, and the spell was not of a
      nature to be menaced by the young American&rsquo;s general gentleness. The
      concluding motive of Marie&rsquo;s writing to her grandmamma to invite Euphemia
      for a three weeks&rsquo; holiday to the castel in Auvergne involved, however,
      the subtlest considerations. Mademoiselle de Mauves indeed, at this time
      seventeen years of age and capable of views as wide as her wants, was as
      proper a figure as could possibly have been found for the foreground of a
      scene artfully designed; and Euphemia, whose years were of like number,
      asked herself if a right harmony with such a place mightn&rsquo;t come by humble
      prayer. It is a proof of the sincerity of the latter&rsquo;s aspirations that
      the castel was not a shock to her faith. It was neither a cheerful nor a
      luxurious abode, but it was as full of wonders as a box of old heirlooms
      or objects &ldquo;willed.&rdquo; It had battered towers and an empty moat, a rusty
      drawbridge and a court paved with crooked grass-grown slabs over which the
      antique coach-wheels of the lady with the hooked nose seemed to awaken the
      echoes of the seventeenth century. Euphemia was not frightened out of her
      dream; she had the pleasure of seeing all the easier passages translated
      into truth, as the learner of a language begins with the common words. She
      had a taste for old servants, old anecdotes, old furniture, faded
      household colours and sweetly stale odours&mdash;musty treasures in which
      the Chateau de Mauves abounded. She made a dozen sketches in water-colours
      after her conventual pattern; but sentimentally, as one may say, she was
      for ever sketching with a freer hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Madame de Mauves had nothing severe but her nose, and she seemed to
      Euphemia&mdash;what indeed she had every claim to pass for&mdash;the very
      image and pattern of an &ldquo;historical character.&rdquo; Belonging to a great order
      of things, she patronised the young stranger who was ready to sit all day
      at her feet and listen to anecdotes of the bon temps and quotations from
      the family chronicles. Madame de Mauves was a very honest old woman; she
      uttered her thoughts with ancient plainness. One day after pushing back
      Euphemia&rsquo;s shining locks and blinking with some tenderness from behind an
      immense face-a-main that acted as for the relegation of the girl herself
      to the glass case of a museum, she declared with an energetic shake of the
      head that she didn&rsquo;t know what to make of such a little person. And in
      answer to the little person&rsquo;s evident wonder, &ldquo;I should like to advise
      you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you seem to me so all of a piece that I&rsquo;m afraid that
      if I advise you I shall spoil you. It&rsquo;s easy to see you&rsquo;re not one of us.
      I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re better, but you seem to me to have been wound
      up by some key that isn&rsquo;t kept by your governess or your confessor or even
      your mother, but that you wear by a fine black ribbon round your own neck.
      Little persons in my day&mdash;when they were stupid they were very
      docile, but when they were clever they were very sly! You&rsquo;re clever
      enough, I imagine, and yet if I guessed all your secrets at this moment is
      there one I should have to frown at? I can tell you a wickeder one than
      any you&rsquo;ve discovered for yourself. If you wish to live at ease in the
      doux pays de France don&rsquo;t trouble too much about the key of your
      conscience or even about your conscience itself&mdash;I mean your own
      particular one. You&rsquo;ll fancy it saying things it won&rsquo;t help your case to
      hear. They&rsquo;ll make you sad, and when you&rsquo;re sad you&rsquo;ll grow plain, and
      when you&rsquo;re plain you&rsquo;ll grow bitter, and when you&rsquo;re bitter you&rsquo;ll be peu
      aimable. I was brought up to think that a woman&rsquo;s first duty is to be
      infinitely so, and the happiest women I&rsquo;ve known have been in fact those
      who performed this duty faithfully. As you&rsquo;re not a Catholic I suppose you
      can&rsquo;t be a devote; and if you don&rsquo;t take life as a fifty years&rsquo; mass the
      only way to take it&rsquo;s as a game of skill. Listen to this. Not to lose at
      the game of life you must&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say cheat, but not be too sure
      your neighbour won&rsquo;t, and not be shocked out of your self-possession if he
      does. Don&rsquo;t lose, my dear&mdash;I beseech you don&rsquo;t lose. Be neither
      suspicious nor credulous, and if you find your neighbour peeping don&rsquo;t cry
      out; only very politely wait your own chance. I&rsquo;ve had my revenge more
      than once in my day, but I really think the sweetest I could take, en
      somme, against the past I&rsquo;ve known, would be to have your blest innocence
      profit by my experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was rather bewildering advice, but Euphemia understood it too little
      to be either edified or frightened. She sat listening to it very much as
      she would have listened to the speeches of an old lady in a comedy whose
      diction should strikingly correspond to the form of her high-backed
      armchair and the fashion of her coif. Her indifference was doubly
      dangerous, for Madame de Mauves spoke at the instance of coming events,
      and her words were the result of a worry of scruples&mdash;scruples in the
      light of which Euphemia was on the one hand too tender a victim to be
      sacrificed to an ambition and the prosperity of her own house on the other
      too precious a heritage to be sacrificed to an hesitation. The prosperity
      in question had suffered repeated and grievous breaches and the menaced
      institution been overmuch pervaded by that cold comfort in which people
      are obliged to balance dinner-table allusions to feudal ancestors against
      the absence of side-dishes; a state of things the sorrier as the family
      was now mainly represented by a gentleman whose appetite was large and who
      justly maintained that its historic glories hadn&rsquo;t been established by
      underfed heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after Euphemia&rsquo;s arrival Richard de Mauves, coming down from
      Paris to pay his respects to his grandmother, treated our heroine to her
      first encounter with a gentilhomme in the flesh. On appearing he kissed
      his grandmother&rsquo;s hand with a smile which caused her to draw it away with
      dignity, and set Euphemia, who was standing by, to ask herself what could
      have happened between them. Her unanswered wonder was but the beginning of
      a long chain of puzzlements, but the reader is free to know that the smile
      of M. de Mauves was a reply to a postscript affixed by the old lady to a
      letter addressed to him by her granddaughter as soon as the girl had been
      admitted to justify the latter&rsquo;s promises. Mademoiselle de Mauves brought
      her letter to her grandmother for approval, but obtained no more than was
      expressed in a frigid nod. The old lady watched her with this coldness
      while she proceeded to seal the letter, then suddenly bade her open it
      again and bring her a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister&rsquo;s flatteries are all nonsense,&rdquo; she wrote; &ldquo;the young lady&rsquo;s
      far too good for you, mauvais sujet beyond redemption. If you&rsquo;ve a
      particle of conscience you&rsquo;ll not come and disturb the repose of an angel
      of innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other relative of the subject of this warning, who had read these
      lines, made up a little face as she freshly indited the address; but she
      laid down her pen with a confident nod which might have denoted that by
      her judgement her brother was appealed to on the ground of a principle
      that didn&rsquo;t exist in him. And &ldquo;if you meant what you said,&rdquo; the young man
      on his side observed to his grandmother on his first private opportunity,
      &ldquo;it would have been simpler not to have sent the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Put out of humour perhaps by this gross impugnment of her sincerity, the
      head of the family kept her room on pretexts during a greater part of
      Euphemia&rsquo;s stay, so that the latter&rsquo;s angelic innocence was left all to
      her grandson&rsquo;s mercy. It suffered no worse mischance, however, than to be
      prompted to intenser communion with itself. Richard de Mauves was the hero
      of the young girl&rsquo;s romance made real, and so completely accordant with
      this creature of her imagination that she felt afraid of him almost as she
      would have been of a figure in a framed picture who should have stepped
      down from the wall. He was now thirty-three&mdash;young enough to suggest
      possibilities of ardent activity and old enough to have formed opinions
      that a simple woman might deem it an intellectual privilege to listen to.
      He was perhaps a trifle handsomer than Euphemia&rsquo;s rather grim Quixotic
      ideal, but a very few days reconciled her to his good looks as effectually
      they would have reconciled her to a characterised want of them. He was
      quiet, grave, eminently distinguished. He spoke little, but his remarks,
      without being sententious, had a nobleness of tone that caused them to
      re-echo in the young girl&rsquo;s ears at the end of the day. He paid her very
      little direct attention, but his chance words&mdash;when he only asked her
      if she objected to his cigarette&mdash;were accompanied by a smile of
      extraordinary kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that shortly after his arrival, riding an unruly horse which
      Euphemia had with shy admiration watched him mount in the castle-yard, he
      was thrown with a violence which, without disparaging his skill, made him
      for a fortnight an interesting invalid lounging in the library with a
      bandaged knee. To beguile his confinement the accomplished young stranger
      was repeatedly induced to sing for him, which she did with a small natural
      tremor that might have passed for the finish of vocal art. He never
      overwhelmed her with compliments, but he listened with unfailing
      attention, remembered all her melodies and would sit humming them to
      himself. While his imprisonment lasted indeed he passed hours in her
      company, making her feel not unlike some unfriended artist who has
      suddenly gained the opportunity to devote a fortnight to the study of a
      great model. Euphemia studied with noiseless diligence what she supposed
      to be the &ldquo;character&rdquo; of M. de Mauves, and the more she looked the more
      fine lights and shades she seemed to behold in this masterpiece of nature.
      M. de Mauves&rsquo;s character indeed, whether from a sense of being so
      generously and intensely taken for granted, or for reasons which bid
      graceful defiance to analysis, had never been so much on show, even to the
      very casual critic lodged, as might be said, in an out-of-the-way corner
      of it; it seemed really to reflect the purity of Euphemia&rsquo;s pious opinion.
      There had been nothing especially to admire in the state of mind in which
      he left Paris&mdash;a settled resolve to marry a young person whose charms
      might or might not justify his sister&rsquo;s account of them, but who was
      mistress, at the worst, of a couple of hundred thousand francs a year. He
      had not counted out sentiment&mdash;if she pleased him so much the better;
      but he had left a meagre margin for it and would hardly have admitted that
      so excellent a match could be improved by it. He was a robust and serene
      sceptic, and it was a singular fate for a man who believed in nothing to
      be so tenderly believed in. What his original faith had been he could
      hardly have told you, for as he came back to his childhood&rsquo;s home to mend
      his fortunes by pretending to fall in love he was a thoroughly perverse
      creature and overlaid with more corruptions than a summer day&rsquo;s
      questioning of his conscience would have put to flight. Ten years&rsquo; pursuit
      of pleasure, which a bureau full of unpaid bills was all he had to show
      for, had pretty well stifled the natural lad whose violent will and
      generous temper might have been shaped by a different pressure to some
      such showing as would have justified a romantic faith. So should he have
      exhaled the natural fragrance of a late-blooming flower of hereditary
      honour. His violence indeed had been subdued and he had learned to be
      irreproachably polite; but he had lost the fineness of his generosity, and
      his politeness, which in the long run society paid for, was hardly more
      than a form of luxurious egotism, like his fondness for ciphered
      pocket-handkerchiefs, lavender gloves and other fopperies by which
      shopkeepers remained out of pocket. In after-years he was terribly polite
      to his wife. He had formed himself, as the phrase was, and the form
      prescribed to him by the society into which his birth and his tastes had
      introduced him was marked by some peculiar features. That which mainly
      concerns us is its classification of the fairer half of humanity as
      objects not essentially different&mdash;say from those very lavender
      gloves that are soiled in an evening and thrown away. To do M. de Mauves
      justice, he had in the course of time encountered in the feminine
      character such plentiful evidence of its pliant softness and fine
      adjustability that idealism naturally seemed to him a losing game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia, as he lay on his sofa, struck him as by no means contradictory;
      she simply reminded him that very young women are generally innocent and
      that this is on the whole the most potent source of their attraction. Her
      innocence moved him to perfect consideration, and it seemed to him that if
      he shortly became her husband it would be exposed to a danger the less.
      Old Madame de Mauves, who flattered herself that in this whole matter she
      was very laudably rigid, might almost have taken a lesson from the
      delicacy he practised. For two or three weeks her grandson was well-nigh a
      blushing boy again. He watched from behind the Figaro, he admired and
      desired and held his tongue. He found himself not in the least moved to a
      flirtation; he had no wish to trouble the waters he proposed to transfuse
      into the golden cup of matrimony. Sometimes a word, a look, a gesture of
      Euphemia&rsquo;s gave him the oddest sense of being, or of seeming at least,
      almost bashful; for she had a way of not dropping her eyes according to
      the mysterious virginal mechanism, of not fluttering out of the room when
      she found him there alone, of treating him rather as a glorious than as a
      pernicious influence&mdash;a radiant frankness of demeanour in fine,
      despite an infinite natural reserve, which it seemed at once graceless not
      to be complimentary about and indelicate not to take for granted. In this
      way had been wrought in the young man&rsquo;s mind a vague unwonted resonance of
      soft impressions, as we may call it, which resembled the happy stir of the
      change from dreaming pleasantly to waking happily. His imagination was
      touched; he was very fond of music and he now seemed to give easy ear to
      some of the sweetest he had ever heard. In spite of the bore of being laid
      up with a lame knee he was in better humour than he had known for months;
      he lay smoking cigarettes and listening to the nightingales with the
      satisfied smile of one of his country neighbours whose big ox should have
      taken the prize at a fair. Every now and then, with an impatient suspicion
      of the resemblance, he declared himself pitifully bete; but he was under a
      charm that braved even the supreme penalty of seeming ridiculous. One
      morning he had half an hour&rsquo;s tete-a-tete with his grandmother&rsquo;s
      confessor, a soft-voiced old Abbe whom, for reasons of her own, Madame de
      Mauves had suddenly summoned and had left waiting in the drawing-room
      while she rearranged her curls. His reverence, going up to the old lady,
      assured her that M. le Comte was in a most edifying state of mind and the
      likeliest subject for the operation of grace. This was a theological
      interpretation of the count&rsquo;s unusual equanimity. He had always lazily
      wondered what priests were good for, and he now remembered, with a sense
      of especial obligation to the Abbe, that they were excellent for marrying
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after this he left off his bandages and tried to walk. He
      made his way into the garden and hobbled successfully along one of the
      alleys, but in the midst of his progress was pulled up by a spasm of pain
      which forced him to stop and call for help. In an instant Euphemia came
      tripping along the path and offered him her arm with the frankest
      solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to the house,&rdquo; he said, taking it; &ldquo;further on, to the bosquet.&rdquo; This
      choice was prompted by her having immediately confessed that she had seen
      him leave the house, had feared an accident and had followed him on
      tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you join me?&rdquo; he had asked, giving her a look in which
      admiration was no longer disguised and yet felt itself half at the mercy
      of her replying that a jeune fille shouldn&rsquo;t be seen following a
      gentleman. But it drew a breath which filled its lungs for a long time
      afterwards when she replied simply that if she had overtaken him he might
      have accepted her arm out of politeness, whereas she wished to have the
      pleasure of seeing him walk alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bosquet was covered with an odorous tangle of blossoming creepers, and
      a nightingale overhead was shaking out love-notes with a profusion that
      made the Count feel his own conduct the last word of propriety. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      always heard that in America, when a man wishes to marry a young girl, he
      offers himself simply face to face and without ceremony&mdash;without
      parents and uncles and aunts and cousins sitting round in a circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I believe so,&rdquo; said Euphemia, staring and too surprised to be
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then&mdash;suppose our arbour here to be your great sensible
      country. I offer you my hand a l&rsquo;Americaine. It will make me intensely
      happy to feel you accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Euphemia&rsquo;s acceptance was in the American manner is more than I
      can say; I incline to think that for fluttering grateful trustful
      softly-amazed young hearts there is only one manner all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, in the massive turret chamber it was her happiness to
      inhabit, she wrote a dutiful letter to her mamma, and had just sealed it
      when she was sent for by Madame de Mauves. She found this ancient lady
      seated in her boudoir in a lavender satin gown and with her candles all
      lighted as for the keeping of some fete. &ldquo;Are you very happy?&rdquo; the old
      woman demanded, making Euphemia sit down before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid to say so, lest I should wake myself up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May you never wake up, belle enfant,&rdquo; Madame de Mauves grandly returned.
      &ldquo;This is the first marriage ever made in our family in this way&mdash;by a
      Comte de Mauves proposing to a young girl in an arbour like Jeannot and
      Jeannette. It has not been our way of doing things, and people may say it
      wants frankness. My grandson tells me he regards it&mdash;for the
      conditions&mdash;as the perfection of good taste. Very well. I&rsquo;m a very
      old woman, and if your differences should ever be as marked as your
      agreements I shouldn&rsquo;t care to see them. But I should be sorry to die and
      think you were going to be unhappy. You can&rsquo;t be, my dear, beyond a
      certain point; because, though in this world the Lord sometimes makes
      light of our expectations he never altogether ignores our deserts. But
      you&rsquo;re very young and innocent and easy to dazzle. There never was a man
      in the world&mdash;among the saints themselves&mdash;as good as you
      believe my grandson. But he&rsquo;s a galant homme and a gentleman, and I&rsquo;ve
      been talking to him to-night. To you I want to say this&mdash;that you&rsquo;re
      to forget the worldly rubbish I talked the other day about the happiness
      of frivolous women. It&rsquo;s not the kind of happiness that would suit you, ma
      toute-belle. Whatever befalls you, promise me this: to be, to remain, your
      own sincere little self only, charming in your own serious little way. The
      Comtesse de Mauves will be none the worse for it. Your brave little self,
      understand, in spite of everything&mdash;bad precepts and bad examples,
      bad fortune and even bad usage. Be persistently and patiently just what
      the good God has made you, and even one of us&mdash;and one of those who
      is most what we ARE&mdash;will do you justice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia remembered this speech in after-years, and more than once,
      wearily closing her eyes, she seemed to see the old woman sitting upright
      in her faded finery and smiling grimly like one of the Fates who sees the
      wheel of fortune turning up her favourite event. But at the moment it had
      for her simply the proper gravity of the occasion: this was the way, she
      supposed, in which lucky young girls were addressed on their engagement by
      wise old women of quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her convent, to which she immediately returned, she found a letter from
      her mother which disconcerted her far more than the remarks of Madame de
      Mauves. Who were these people, Mrs. Cleve demanded, who had presumed to
      talk to her daughter of marriage without asking her leave? Questionable
      gentlefolk plainly; the best French people never did such things. Euphemia
      would return straightway to her convent, shut herself up and await her own
      arrival. It took Mrs. Cleve three weeks to travel from Nice to Paris, and
      during this time the young girl had no communication with her lover beyond
      accepting a bouquet of violets marked with his initials and left by a
      female friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not brought you up with such devoted care,&rdquo; she
      declared to her daughter at their first interview, &ldquo;to marry a
      presumptuous and penniless Frenchman. I shall take you straight home and
      you&rsquo;ll please forget M. de Mauves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cleve received that evening at her hotel a visit from this personage
      which softened her wrath but failed to modify her decision. He had very
      good manners, but she was sure he had horrible morals; and the lady, who
      had been a good-natured censor on her own account, felt a deep and real
      need to sacrifice her daughter to propriety. She belonged to that large
      class of Americans who make light of their native land in familiar
      discourse but are startled back into a sense of having blasphemed when
      they find Europeans taking them at their word. &ldquo;I know the type, my dear,&rdquo;
       she said to her daughter with a competent nod. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t beat you.
      Sometimes you&rsquo;ll wish he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia remained solemnly silent, for the only answer she felt capable of
      making was that her mother&rsquo;s mind was too small a measure of things and
      her lover&rsquo;s type an historic, a social masterpiece that it took some
      mystic illumination to appreciate. A person who confounded him with the
      common throng of her watering-place acquaintance was not a person to argue
      with. It struck the girl she had simply no cause to plead; her cause was
      in the Lord&rsquo;s hands and in those of M. de Mauves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agent of Providence had been irritated and mortified by Mrs. Cleve&rsquo;s
      opposition, and hardly knew how to handle an adversary who failed to
      perceive that a member of his family gave of necessity more than he
      received. But he had obtained information on his return to Paris which
      exalted the uses of humility. Euphemia&rsquo;s fortune, wonderful to say, was
      greater than its fame, and in view of such a prize, even a member of his
      family could afford to take a snubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s tact, his deference, his urbane insistence, won a
      concession from Mrs. Cleve. The engagement was to be put off and her
      daughter was to return home, be brought out and receive the homage she was
      entitled to and which might well take a form representing peril to the
      suit of this first headlong aspirant. They were to exchange neither
      letters nor mementoes nor messages; but if at the end of two years
      Euphemia had refused offers enough to attest the permanence of her
      attachment he should receive an invitation to address her again. This
      decision was promulgated in the presence of the parties interested. The
      Count bore himself gallantly, looking at his young friend as if he
      expected some tender protestation. But she only looked at him silently in
      return, neither weeping nor smiling nor putting out her hand. On this they
      separated, and as M. de Mauves walked away he declared to himself that in
      spite of the confounded two years he was one of the luckiest of men&mdash;to
      have a fiancee who to several millions of francs added such strangely
      beautiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many offers Euphemia refused but scantily concerns us&mdash;and how
      the young man wore his two years away. He found he required pastimes, and
      as pastimes were expensive he added heavily to the list of debts to be
      cancelled by Euphemia&rsquo;s fortune. Sometimes, in the thick of what he had
      once called pleasure with a keener conviction than now, he put to himself
      the case of their failing him after all; and then he remembered that last
      mute assurance of her pale face and drew a long breath of such confidence
      as he felt in nothing else in the world save his own punctuality in an
      affair of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one morning, he took the express to Havre with a letter of Mrs.
      Cleve&rsquo;s in his pocket, and ten days later made his bow to mother and
      daughter in New York. His stay was brief, and he was apparently unable to
      bring himself to view what Euphemia&rsquo;s uncle, Mr. Butterworth, who gave her
      away at the altar, called our great experiment of democratic
      self-government, in a serious light. He smiled at everything and seemed to
      regard the New World as a colossal plaisanterie. It is true that a
      perpetual smile was the most natural expression of countenance for a man
      about to marry Euphemia Cleve.

      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Longmore&rsquo;s first visit seemed to open to him so large a range of quiet
      pleasure that he very soon paid a second, and at the end of a fortnight
      had spent uncounted hours in the little drawing-room which Madame de
      Mauves rarely quitted except to drive or walk in the forest. She lived in
      an old-fashioned pavilion, between a high-walled court and an excessively
      artificial garden, beyond whose enclosure you saw a long line of
      tree-tops. Longmore liked the garden and in the mild afternoons used to
      move his chair through the open window to the smooth terrace which
      overlooked it while his hostess sat just within. Presently she would come
      out and wander through the narrow alleys and beside the thin-spouting
      fountain, and at last introduce him to a private gate in the high wall,
      the opening to a lane which led to the forest. Hitherwards she more than
      once strolled with him, bareheaded and meaning to go but twenty rods, but
      always going good-naturedly further and often stretching it to the freedom
      of a promenade. They found many things to talk about, and to the pleasure
      of feeling the hours slip along like some silver stream Longmore was able
      to add the satisfaction of suspecting that he was a &ldquo;resource&rdquo; for Madame
      de Mauves. He had made her acquaintance with the sense, not wholly
      inspiring, that she was a woman with a painful twist in her life and that
      seeking her acquaintance would be like visiting at a house where there was
      an invalid who could bear no noise. But he very soon recognised that her
      grievance, if grievance it was, was not aggressive; that it was not fond
      of attitudes and ceremonies, and that her most earnest wish was to
      remember it as little as possible. He felt that even if Mrs. Draper hadn&rsquo;t
      told him she was unhappy he would have guessed it, and yet that he
      couldn&rsquo;t have pointed to his proof. The evidence was chiefly negative&mdash;she
      never alluded to her husband. Beyond this it seemed to him simply that her
      whole being was pitched in a lower key than harmonious Nature had
      designed; she was like a powerful singer who had lost her high notes. She
      never drooped nor sighed nor looked unutterable things; she dealt no
      sarcastic digs at her fate; she had in short none of the conscious graces
      of the woman wronged. Only Longmore was sure that her gentle gaiety was
      but the milder or sharper flush of a settled ache, and that she but tried
      to interest herself in his thoughts in order to escape from her own. If
      she had wished to irritate his curiosity and lead him to take her
      confidence by storm nothing could have served her purpose better than this
      studied discretion. He measured the rare magnanimity of self-effacement so
      deliberate, he felt how few women were capable of exchanging a luxurious
      woe for a thankless effort. Madame de Mauves, he himself felt, wasn&rsquo;t
      sweeping the horizon for a compensation or a consoler; she had suffered a
      personal deception that had disgusted her with persons. She wasn&rsquo;t
      planning to get the worth of her trouble back in some other way; for the
      present she was proposing to live with it peaceably, reputably and without
      scandal&mdash;turning the key on it occasionally as you would on a
      companion liable to attacks of insanity. Longmore was a man of fine senses
      and of a speculative spirit, leading-strings that had never been slipped.
      He began to regard his hostess as a figure haunted by a shadow which was
      somehow her intenser and more authentic self. This lurking duality in her
      put on for him an extraordinary charm. Her delicate beauty acquired to his
      eye the serious cast of certain blank-browed Greek statues; and sometimes
      when his imagination, more than his ear, detected a vague tremor in the
      tone in which she attempted to make a friendly question seem to have
      behind it none of the hollow resonance of absent-mindedness, his
      marvelling eyes gave her an answer more eloquent, though much less to the
      point, than the one she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She supplied him indeed with much to wonder about, so that he fitted, in
      his ignorance, a dozen high-flown theories to her apparent history. She
      had married for love and staked her whole soul on it; of that he was
      convinced. She hadn&rsquo;t changed her allegiance to be near Paris and her base
      of supplies of millinery; he was sure she had seen her perpetrated mistake
      in a light of which her present life, with its conveniences for shopping
      and its moral aridity, was the absolute negation. But by what
      extraordinary process of the heart&mdash;through what mysterious
      intermission of that moral instinct which may keep pace with the heart
      even when this organ is making unprecedented time&mdash;had she fixed her
      affections on an insolently frivolous Frenchman? Longmore needed no
      telling; he knew that M. de Mauves was both cynical and shallow; these
      things were stamped on his eyes, his nose, his mouth, his voice, his
      gesture, his step. Of Frenchwomen themselves, when all was said, our young
      man, full of nursed discriminations, went in no small fear; they all
      seemed to belong to the type of a certain fine lady to whom he had
      ventured to present a letter of introduction and whom, directly after his
      first visit to her, he had set down in his note-book as &ldquo;metallic.&rdquo; Why
      should Madame de Mauves have chosen a Frenchwoman&rsquo;s lot&mdash;she whose
      nature had an atmospheric envelope absent even from the brightest metals?
      He asked her one day frankly if it had cost her nothing to transplant
      herself&mdash;if she weren&rsquo;t oppressed with a sense of irreconcileable
      difference from &ldquo;all these people.&rdquo; She replied nothing at first, till he
      feared she might think it her duty to resent a question that made light of
      all her husband&rsquo;s importances. He almost wished she would; it would seem a
      proof that her policy of silence had a limit. &ldquo;I almost grew up here,&rdquo; she
      said at last, &ldquo;and it was here for me those visions of the future took
      shape that we all have when we begin to think or to dream beyond mere
      playtime. As matters stand one may be very American and yet arrange it
      with one&rsquo;s conscience to live in Europe. My imagination perhaps&mdash;I
      had a little when I was younger&mdash;helped me to think I should find
      happiness here. And after all, for a woman, what does it signify? This
      isn&rsquo;t America, no&mdash;this element, but it&rsquo;s quite as little France.
      France is out there beyond the garden, France is in the town and the
      forest; but here, close about me, in my room and&rdquo;&mdash;she paused a
      moment&mdash;&ldquo;in my mind, it&rsquo;s a nameless, and doubtless not at all
      remarkable, little country of my own. It&rsquo;s not her country,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;that makes a woman happy or unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin, Euphemia&rsquo;s sister-in-law, might meanwhile have been
      supposed to have undertaken the graceful task of making Longmore ashamed
      of his uncivil jottings about her sex and nation. Mademoiselle de Mauves,
      bringing example to the confirmation of precept, had made a remunerative
      match and sacrificed her name to the millions of a prosperous and aspiring
      wholesale druggist&mdash;a gentleman liberal enough to regard his fortune
      as a moderate price for being towed into circles unpervaded by
      pharmaceutic odours. His system possibly was sound, but his own
      application of it to be deplored. M. Clairin&rsquo;s head was turned by his good
      luck. Having secured an aristocratic wife he adopted an aristocratic vice
      and began to gamble at the Bourse. In an evil hour he lost heavily, and
      then staked heavily to recover himself. But he was to learn that the law
      of compensation works with no such pleasing simplicity, and he rolled to
      the dark bottom of his folly. There he felt everything go&mdash;his wits,
      his courage, his probity, everything that had made him what his fatuous
      marriage had so promptly unmade. He walked up the Rue Vivienne with his
      hands in his empty pockets and stood half an hour staring confusedly up
      and down the brave boulevard. People brushed against him and half a dozen
      carriages almost ran over him, until at last a policeman, who had been
      watching him for some time, took him by the arm and led him gently away.
      He looked at the man&rsquo;s cocked hat and sword with tears in his eyes; he
      hoped for some practical application of the wrath of heaven, something
      that would express violently his dead-weight of self-abhorrence. The
      sergent de ville, however, only stationed him in the embrasure of a door,
      out of harm&rsquo;s way, and walked off to supervise a financial contest between
      an old lady and a cabman. Poor M. Clairin had only been married a year,
      but he had had time to measure the great spirit of true children of the
      anciens preux. When night had fallen he repaired to the house of a friend
      and asked for a night&rsquo;s lodging; and as his friend, who was simply his old
      head book-keeper and lived in a small way, was put to some trouble to
      accommodate him, &ldquo;You must pardon me,&rdquo; the poor man said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t go
      home. I&rsquo;m afraid of my wife!&rdquo; Toward morning he blew his brains out. His
      widow turned the remnants of his property to better account than could
      have been expected and wore the very handsomest mourning. It was for this
      latter reason perhaps that she was obliged to retrench at other points and
      accept a temporary home under her brother&rsquo;s roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune had played Madame Clairin a terrible trick, but had found an
      adversary and not a victim. Though quite without beauty she had always had
      what is called the grand air, and her air from this time forth was grander
      than ever. As she trailed about in her sable furbelows, tossing back her
      well-dressed head and holding up her vigilant long-handled eyeglass, she
      seemed to be sweeping the whole field of society and asking herself where
      she should pluck her revenge. Suddenly she espied it, ready made to her
      hand, in poor Longmore&rsquo;s wealth and amiability. American dollars and
      American complaisance had made her brother&rsquo;s fortune; why shouldn&rsquo;t they
      make hers? She overestimated the wealth and misinterpreted the amiability;
      for she was sure a man could neither be so contented without being rich
      nor so &ldquo;backward&rdquo; without being weak. Longmore met her advances with a
      formal politeness that covered a good deal of unflattering discomposure.
      She made him feel deeply uncomfortable; and though he was at a loss to
      conceive how he could be an object of interest to a sharp Parisienne he
      had an indefinable sense of being enclosed in a magnetic circle, of having
      become the victim of an incantation. If Madame Clairin could have fathomed
      his Puritanic soul she would have laid by her wand and her book and
      dismissed him for an impossible subject. She gave him a moral chill, and
      he never named her to himself save as that dreadful woman&mdash;that awful
      woman. He did justice to her grand air, but for his pleasure he preferred
      the small air of Madame de Mauves; and he never made her his bow, after
      standing frigidly passive for five minutes to one of her gracious
      overtures to intimacy, without feeling a peculiar desire to ramble away
      into the forest, fling himself down on the warm grass and, staring up at
      the blue sky, forget that there were any women in nature who didn&rsquo;t please
      like the swaying tree-tops. One day, on his arrival at the house, she met
      him in the court with the news that her sister-in-law was shut up with a
      headache and that his visit must be for HER. He followed her into the
      drawing-room with the best grace at his command, and sat twirling his hat
      for half an hour. Suddenly he understood her; her caressing cadences were
      so almost explicit an invitation to solicit the charming honour of her
      hand. He blushed to the roots of his hair and jumped up with
      uncontrollable alacrity; then, dropping a glance at Madame Clairin, who
      sat watching him with hard eyes over the thin edge of her smile, perceived
      on her brow a flash of unforgiving wrath. It was not pleasing in itself,
      but his eyes lingered a moment, for it seemed to show off her character.
      What he saw in the picture frightened him and he felt himself murmur &ldquo;Poor
      Madame de Mauves!&rdquo; His departure was abrupt, and this time he really went
      into the forest and lay down on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which he admired his young countrywoman more than ever; her
      intrinsic clearness shone out to him even through the darker shade cast
      over it. At the end of a month he received a letter from a friend with
      whom he had arranged a tour through the Low Countries, reminding him of
      his promise to keep their tryst at Brussels. It was only after his answer
      was posted that he fully measured the zeal with which he had declared that
      the journey must either be deferred or abandoned&mdash;since he couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly leave Saint-Germain. He took a walk in the forest and asked
      himself if this were indeed portentously true. Such a truth somehow made
      it surely his duty to march straight home and put together his effects.
      Poor Webster, who, he knew, had counted ardently on this excursion, was
      the best of men; six weeks ago he would have gone through anything to join
      poor Webster. It had never been in his books to throw overboard a friend
      whom he had loved ten years for a married woman whom he had six weeks&mdash;well,
      admired. It was certainly beyond question that he hung on at Saint-Germain
      because this admirable married woman was there; but in the midst of so
      much admiration what had become of his fine old power to conclude? This
      was the conduct of a man not judging but drifting, and he had pretended
      never to drift. If she were as unhappy as he believed the active sympathy
      of such a man would help her very little more than his indifference; if
      she were less so she needed no help and could dispense with his
      professions. He was sure moreover that if she knew he was staying on her
      account she would be extremely annoyed. This very feeling indeed had much
      to do with making it hard to go; her displeasure would be the flush on the
      snow of the high cold stoicism that touched him to the heart. At moments
      withal he assured himself that staying to watch her&mdash;and what else
      did it come to?&mdash;was simply impertinent; it was gross to keep tugging
      at the cover of a book so intentionally closed. Then inclination answered
      that some day her self-support would fail, and he had a vision of this
      exquisite creature calling vainly for help. He would just be her friend to
      any length, and it was unworthy of either to think about consequences. He
      was a friend, however, who nursed a brooding regret for his not having
      known her five years earlier, as well as a particular objection to those
      who had smartly anticipated him. It seemed one of fortune&rsquo;s most mocking
      strokes that she should be surrounded by persons whose only merit was that
      they threw every side of her, as she turned in her pain, into radiant
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young man&rsquo;s growing irritation made it more and more difficult for him
      to see any other merit than this in Richard de Mauves. And yet,
      disinterestedly, it would have been hard to give a name to the pitiless
      perversity lighted by such a conclusion, and there were times when
      Longmore was almost persuaded against his finer judgement that he was
      really the most considerate of husbands and that it was not a man&rsquo;s fault
      if his wife&rsquo;s love of life had pitched itself once for all in the minor
      key. The Count&rsquo;s manners were perfect, his discretion irreproachable, and
      he seemed never to address his companion but, sentimentally speaking, hat
      in hand. His tone to Longmore&mdash;as the latter was perfectly aware&mdash;was
      that of a man of the world to a man not quite of the world; but what it
      lacked in true frankness it made up in easy form. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you
      enough for having overcome my wife&rsquo;s shyness,&rdquo; he more than once declared.
      &ldquo;If we left her to do as she pleased she would&mdash;in her youth and her
      beauty&mdash;bury herself all absurdly alive. Come often, and bring your
      good friends and compatriots&mdash;some of them are so amusing. She&rsquo;ll
      have nothing to do with mine, but perhaps you&rsquo;ll be able to offer her
      better son affaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves made these speeches with a bright assurance very amazing to
      our hero, who had an innocent belief that a man&rsquo;s head may point out to
      him the shortcomings of his heart and make him ashamed of them. He
      couldn&rsquo;t fancy him formed both to neglect his wife and to take the
      derisive view of her minding it. Longmore had at any rate an exasperated
      sense that this nobleman thought rather the less of their interesting
      friend on account of that very same fine difference of nature which so
      deeply stirred his own sympathies. He was rarely present during the
      sessions of the American visitor, and he made a daily journey to Paris,
      where he had de gros soucis d&rsquo;affaires as he once mentioned&mdash;with an
      all-embracing flourish and not in the least in the tone of apology. When
      he appeared it was late in the evening and with an imperturbable air of
      being on the best of terms with every one and every thing which was
      peculiarly annoying if you happened to have a tacit quarrel with him. If
      he was an honest man he was an honest man somehow spoiled for confidence.
      Something he had, however, that his critic vaguely envied, something in
      his address, splendidly positive, a manner rounded and polished by the
      habit of conversation and the friction of full experience, an urbanity
      exercised for his own sake, not for his neighbour&rsquo;s, which seemed the
      fruit of one of those strong temperaments that rule the inward scene
      better than the best conscience. The Count had plainly no sense for
      morals, and poor Longmore, who had the finest, would have been glad to
      borrow his recipe for appearing then so to range the whole scale of the
      senses. What was it that enabled him, short of being a monster with
      visibly cloven feet and exhaling brimstone, to misprize so cruelly a
      nature like his wife&rsquo;s and to walk about the world with such a handsome
      invincible grin? It was the essential grossness of his imagination, which
      had nevertheless helped him to such a store of neat speeches. He could be
      highly polite and could doubtless be damnably impertinent, but the life of
      the spirit was a world as closed to him as the world of great music to a
      man without an ear. It was ten to one he didn&rsquo;t in the least understand
      how his wife felt; he and his smooth sister had doubtless agreed to regard
      their relative as a Puritanical little person, of meagre aspirations and
      few talents, content with looking at Paris from the terrace and, as a
      special treat, having a countryman very much like herself to regale her
      with innocent echoes of their native wit. M. de Mauves was tired of his
      companion; he liked women who could, frankly, amuse him better. She was
      too dim, too delicate, too modest; she had too few arts, too little
      coquetry, too much charity. Lighting a cigar some day while he summed up
      his situation, her husband had probably decided she was incurably stupid.
      It was the same taste, in essence, our young man moralised, as the taste
      for M. Gerome and M. Baudry in painting and for M. Gustave Flaubert and M.
      Charles Baudelaire in literature. The Count was a pagan and his wife a
      Christian, and between them an impassable gulf. He was by race and
      instinct a grand seigneur. Longmore had often heard of that historic type,
      and was properly grateful for an opportunity to examine it closely. It had
      its elegance of outline, but depended on spiritual sources so remote from
      those of which he felt the living gush in his own soul that he found
      himself gazing at it, in irreconcileable antipathy, through a dim historic
      mist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a modern bourgeois,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and not perhaps so good a judge
      of how far a pretty woman&rsquo;s tongue may go at supper before the mirrors
      properly crack to hear. But I&rsquo;ve not met one of the rarest of women
      without recognising her, without making my reflexion that, charm for
      charm, such a maniere d&rsquo;etre is more &lsquo;fetching&rsquo; even than the worst of
      Theresa&rsquo;s songs sung by a dissipated duchess. Wit for wit, I think mine
      carries me further.&rdquo; It was easy indeed to perceive that, as became a
      grand seigneur, M. de Mauves had a stock of social principles. He wouldn&rsquo;t
      especially have desired perhaps that his wife should compete in amateur
      operettas with the duchesses in question, for the most part of
      comparatively recent origin; but he held that a gentleman may take his
      amusement where he finds it, that he is quite at liberty not to find it at
      home, and that even an adoptive daughter of his house who should hang her
      head and have red eyes and allow herself to make any other response to
      officious condolence than that her husband&rsquo;s amusements were his own
      affair, would have forfeited every claim to having her finger-tips bowed
      over and kissed. And yet in spite of this definite faith Longmore figured
      him much inconvenienced by the Countess&rsquo;s avoidance of betrayals. Did it
      dimly occur to him that the principle of this reserve was self-control and
      not self-effacement? She was a model to all the inferior matrons of his
      line, past and to come, and an occasional &ldquo;scene&rdquo; from her at a manageable
      hour would have had something reassuring&mdash;would have attested her
      stupidity rather better than this mere polish of her patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore would have given much to be able to guess how this latter secret
      worked, and he tried more than once, though timidly and awkwardly enough,
      to make out the game she was playing. She struck him as having long
      resisted the force of cruel evidence, and, as though succumbing to it at
      last, having denied herself on simple grounds of generosity the right to
      complain. Her faith might have perished, but the sense of her own old deep
      perversity remained. He believed her thus quite capable of reproaching
      herself with having expected too much and of trying to persuade herself
      out of her bitterness by saying that her hopes had been vanities and
      follies and that what was before her was simply Life. &ldquo;I hate tragedy,&rdquo;
       she once said to him; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dreadful coward about having to suffer or to
      bleed. I&rsquo;ve always tried to believe that&mdash;without base concessions&mdash;such
      extremities may always somehow be dodged or indefinitely postponed. I
      should be willing to buy myself off, from having ever to be OVERWHELMED,
      by giving up&mdash;well, any amusement you like.&rdquo; She lived evidently in
      nervous apprehension of being fatally convinced&mdash;of seeing to the end
      of her deception. Longmore, when he thought of this, felt the force of his
      desire to offer her something of which she could be as sure as of the sun
      in heaven.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      His friend Webster meanwhile lost no time in accusing him of the basest
      infidelity and in asking him what he found at suburban Saint-Germain to
      prefer to Van Eyck and Memling, Rubens and Rembrandt. A day or two after
      the receipt of this friend&rsquo;s letter he took a walk with Madame de Mauves
      in the forest. They sat down on a fallen log and she began to arrange into
      a bouquet the anemones and violets she had gathered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word here,&rdquo;
       he said at last, &ldquo;from a friend whom I some time ago promised to join in
      Brussels. The time has come&mdash;it has passed. It finds me terribly
      unwilling to leave Saint-Germain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with the immediate interest she always showed in his
      affairs, but with no hint of a disposition to make a personal application
      of his words. &ldquo;Saint-Germain is pleasant enough, but are you doing
      yourself justice? Shan&rsquo;t you regret in future days that instead of
      travelling and seeing cities and monuments and museums and improving your
      mind you simply sat here&mdash;for instance&mdash;on a log and pulled my
      flowers to pieces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I shall regret in future days,&rdquo; he answered after some hesitation,
      &ldquo;is that I should have sat here&mdash;sat here so much&mdash;and never
      have shown what&rsquo;s the matter with me. I&rsquo;m fond of museums and monuments
      and of improving my mind, and I&rsquo;m particularly fond of my friend Webster.
      But I can&rsquo;t bring myself to leave Saint-Germain without asking you a
      question. You must forgive me if it&rsquo;s indiscreet and be assured that
      curiosity was never more respectful. Are you really as unhappy as I
      imagine you to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had evidently not expected his appeal, and, making her change colour,
      it took her unprepared. &ldquo;If I strike you as unhappy,&rdquo; she none the less
      simply said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a poorer friend to you than I wished to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, perhaps, have been a better friend of yours than you&rsquo;ve supposed,&rdquo; he
      returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve admired your reserve, your courage, your studied gaiety.
      But I&rsquo;ve felt the existence of something beneath them that was more YOU&mdash;more
      you as I wished to know you&mdash;than they were; some trouble in you that
      I&rsquo;ve permitted myself to hate and resent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened all gravely, but without an air of offence, and he felt that
      while he had been timorously calculating the last consequences of
      friendship she had quietly enough accepted them. &ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; she
      said slowly, and her flush still lingered. &ldquo;But to refuse to answer you
      would confirm some impression in you even now much too strong. Any
      &lsquo;trouble&rsquo;&mdash;if you mean any unhappiness&mdash;that one can sit
      comfortably talking about is an unhappiness with distinct limitations. If
      I were examined before a board of commissioners for testing the felicity
      of mankind I&rsquo;m sure I should be pronounced a very fortunate woman.&rdquo; There
      was something that deeply touched him in her tone, and this quality
      pierced further as she continued. &ldquo;But let me add, with all gratitude for
      your sympathy, that it&rsquo;s my own affair altogether. It needn&rsquo;t disturb you,
      my dear sir,&rdquo; she wound up with a certain quaintness of gaiety, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve
      often found myself in your company contented enough and diverted enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a wonderful woman,&rdquo; the young man declared, &ldquo;and I admire
      you as I&rsquo;ve never admired any one. You&rsquo;re wiser than anything I, for one,
      can say to you; and what I ask of you is not to let me advise or console
      you, but simply thank you for letting me know you.&rdquo; He had intended no
      such outburst as this, but his voice rang loud and he felt an unfamiliar
      joy as he uttered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head with some impatience. &ldquo;Let us be friends&mdash;as I
      supposed we were going to be&mdash;without protestations and fine words.
      To have you paying compliments to my wisdom&mdash;that would be real
      wretchedness. I can dispense with your admiration better than the Flemish
      painters can&mdash;better than Van Eyck and Rubens, in spite of all their
      worshippers. Go join your friend&mdash;see everything, enjoy everything,
      learn everything, and write me an excellent letter, brimming over with
      your impressions. I&rsquo;m extremely fond of the Dutch painters,&rdquo; she added
      with the faintest quaver in the world, an impressible break of voice that
      Longmore had noticed once or twice before and had interpreted as the
      sudden weariness, the controlled convulsion, of a spirit self-condemned to
      play a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you care a button for the Dutch painters,&rdquo; he said with a
      laugh. &ldquo;But I shall certainly write you a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and turned homeward, thoughtfully rearranging her flowers as she
      walked. Little was said; Longmore was asking himself with an agitation of
      his own in the unspoken words whether all this meant simply that he was in
      love. He looked at the rooks wheeling against the golden-hued sky, between
      the tree-tops, but not at his companion, whose personal presence seemed
      lost in the felicity she had created. Madame de Mauves was silent and
      grave&mdash;she felt she had almost grossly failed and she was
      proportionately disappointed. An emotional friendship she had not desired;
      her scheme had been to pass with her visitor as a placid creature with a
      good deal of leisure which she was disposed to devote to profitable
      conversation of an impersonal sort. She liked him extremely, she felt in
      him the living force of something to which, when she made up her girlish
      mind that a needy nobleman was the ripest fruit of time, she had done too
      scant justice. They went through the little gate in the garden-wall and
      approached the house. On the terrace Madame Clairin was entertaining a
      friend&mdash;a little elderly gentleman with a white moustache and an
      order in his buttonhole. Madame de Mauves chose to pass round the house
      into the court; whereupon her sister-in-law, greeting Longmore with an
      authoritative nod, lifted her eye-glass and stared at them as they went
      by. Longmore heard the little old gentleman uttering some old-fashioned
      epigram about &ldquo;la vieille galanterie francaise&rdquo;&mdash;then by a sudden
      impulse he looked at Madame de Mauves and wondered what she was doing in
      such a world. She stopped before the house, not asking him to come in. &ldquo;I
      hope you will act on my advice and waste no more time at Saint-Germain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant there rose to his lips some faded compliment about his time
      not being wasted, but it expired before the simple sincerity of her look.
      She stood there as gently serious as the angel of disinterestedness, and
      it seemed to him he should insult her by treating her words as a bait for
      flattery. &ldquo;I shall start in a day or two,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t
      promise you not to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I expect to be here a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come and say good-bye,&rdquo; he returned&mdash;which she appeared to
      accept with a smile as she went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment, then walked slowly homeward by the terrace. It seemed
      to him that to leave her thus, for a gain on which she herself insisted,
      was to know her better and admire her more. But he was aware of a vague
      ferment of feeling which her evasion of his question half an hour before
      had done more to deepen than to allay. In the midst of it suddenly, on the
      great terrace of the Chateau, he encountered M. de Mauves, planted there
      against the parapet and finishing a cigar. The Count, who, he thought he
      made out, had an air of peculiar affability, offered him his white plump
      hand. Longmore stopped; he felt a sharp, a sore desire to cry out to him
      that he had the most precious wife in the world, that he ought to be
      ashamed of himself not to know it, and that for all his grand assurance he
      had never looked down into the depths of her eyes. Richard de Mauves, we
      have seen, considered he had; but there was doubtless now something in
      this young woman&rsquo;s eyes that had not been there five years before. The two
      men conversed formally enough, and M. de Mauves threw off a light bright
      remark or two about his visit to America. His tone was not soothing to
      Longmore&rsquo;s excited sensibilities. He seemed to have found the country a
      gigantic joke, and his blandness went but so far as to allow that jokes on
      that scale are indeed inexhaustible. Longmore was not by habit an
      aggressive apologist for the seat of his origin, but the Count&rsquo;s easy
      diagnosis confirmed his worst estimate of French superficiality. He had
      understood nothing, felt nothing, learned nothing, and his critic,
      glancing askance at his aristocratic profile, declared that if the chief
      merit of a long pedigree was to leave one so fatuously stupid he thanked
      goodness the Longmores had emerged from obscurity in the present century
      and in the person of an enterprising timber-merchant. M. de Mauves dwelt
      of course on that prime oddity of the American order&mdash;the liberty
      allowed the fairer half of the unmarried young, and confessed to some
      personal study of the &ldquo;occasions&rdquo; it offered to the speculative visitor; a
      line of research in which, during a fortnight&rsquo;s stay, he had clearly spent
      his most agreeable hours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to admit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that in every
      case I was disarmed by the extreme candour of the young lady, and that
      they took care of themselves to better purpose than I have seen some
      mammas in France take care of them.&rdquo; Longmore greeted this handsome
      concession with the grimmest of smiles and damned his impertinent
      patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentioning, however, at last that he was about to leave Saint-Germain, he
      was surprised, without exactly being flattered, by his interlocutor&rsquo;s
      quickened attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so very sorry; I hoped we had you for the whole
      summer.&rdquo; Longmore murmured something civil and wondered why M. de Mauves
      should care whether he stayed or went. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a real resource to
      Madame de Mauves,&rdquo; the Count added; &ldquo;I assure you I&rsquo;ve mentally blessed
      your visits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were a great pleasure to me,&rdquo; Longmore said gravely. &ldquo;Some day I
      expect to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do&rdquo;&mdash;and the Count made a great and friendly point of it. &ldquo;You
      see the confidence I have in you.&rdquo; Longmore said nothing and M. de Mauves
      puffed his cigar reflectively and watched the smoke. &ldquo;Madame de Mauves,&rdquo;
       he said at last, &ldquo;is a rather singular person.&rdquo; And then while our young
      man shifted his position and wondered whether he was going to &ldquo;explain&rdquo;
       Madame de Mauves, &ldquo;Being, as you are, her fellow countryman,&rdquo; this lady&rsquo;s
      husband pursued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind speaking frankly. She&rsquo;s a little
      overstrained; the most charming woman in the world, as you see, but a
      little volontaire and morbid. Now you see she has taken this extraordinary
      fancy for solitude. I can&rsquo;t get her to go anywhere, to see any one. When
      my friends present themselves she&rsquo;s perfectly polite, but it cures them of
      coming again. She doesn&rsquo;t do herself justice, and I expect every day to
      hear two or three of them say to me, &lsquo;Your wife&rsquo;s jolie a croquer: what a
      pity she hasn&rsquo;t a little esprit.&rsquo; You must have found out that she has
      really a great deal. But, to tell the whole truth, what she needs is to
      forget herself. She sits alone for hours poring over her English books and
      looking at life through that terrible brown fog they seem to me&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      they?&mdash;to fling over the world. I doubt if your English authors,&rdquo; the
      Count went on with a serenity which Longmore afterwards characterised as
      sublime, &ldquo;are very sound reading for young married women. I don&rsquo;t pretend
      to know much about them; but I remember that not long after our marriage
      Madame de Mauves undertook to read me one day some passages from a certain
      Wordsworth&mdash;a poet highly esteemed, it appears, chez vous. It was as
      if she had taken me by the nape of the neck and held my head for half an
      hour over a basin of soupe aux choux: I felt as if we ought to ventilate
      the drawing-room before any one called. But I suppose you know him&mdash;ce
      genie-la. Every nation has its own ideals of every kind, but when I
      remember some of OUR charming writers! I think at all events my wife never
      forgave me and that it was a real shock to her to find she had married a
      man who had very much the same taste in literature as in cookery. But
      you&rsquo;re a man of general culture, a man of the world,&rdquo; said M. de Mauves,
      turning to Longmore but looking hard at the seal of his watchguard. &ldquo;You
      can talk about everything, and I&rsquo;m sure you like Alfred de Musset as well
      as Monsieur Wordsworth. Talk to her about everything you can, Alfred de
      Musset included. Bah! I forgot you&rsquo;re going. Come back then as soon as
      possible and report on your travels. If my wife too would make a little
      voyage it would do her great good. It would enlarge her horizon&rdquo;&mdash;and
      M. de Mauves made a series of short nervous jerks with his stick in the
      air&mdash;&ldquo;it would wake up her imagination. She&rsquo;s too much of one piece,
      you know&mdash;it would show her how much one may bend without breaking.&rdquo;
       He paused a moment and gave two or three vigorous puffs. Then turning to
      his companion again with eyebrows expressively raised: &ldquo;I hope you admire
      my candour. I beg you to believe I wouldn&rsquo;t say such things to one of US!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evening was at hand and the lingering light seemed to charge the air with
      faintly golden motes. Longmore stood gazing at these luminous particles;
      he could almost have fancied them a swarm of humming insects, the chorus
      of a refrain: &ldquo;She has a great deal of esprit&mdash;she has a great deal
      of esprit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;she has a great deal,&rdquo; he said mechanically,
      turning to the Count. M. de Mauves glanced at him sharply, as if to ask
      what the deuce he was talking about. &ldquo;She has a great deal of
      intelligence,&rdquo; said Longmore quietly, &ldquo;a great deal of beauty, a great
      many virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves busied himself for a moment in lighting another cigar, and
      when he had finished, with a return of his confidential smile, &ldquo;I suspect
      you of thinking that I don&rsquo;t do my wife justice.&rdquo; he made answer. &ldquo;Take
      care&mdash;take care, young man; that&rsquo;s a dangerous assumption. In general
      a man always does his wife justice. More than justice,&rdquo; the Count laughed&mdash;&ldquo;that
      we keep for the wives of other men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore afterwards remembered in favour of his friend&rsquo;s fine manner that
      he had not measured at this moment the dusky abyss over which it hovered.
      Hut a deepening subterranean echo, loudest at the last, lingered on his
      spiritual ear. For the present his keenest sensation was a desire to get
      away and cry aloud that M. de Mauves was no better than a pompous dunce.
      He bade him an abrupt good-night, which was to serve also, he said, as
      good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly then you go?&rdquo; It was spoken almost with the note of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course you&rsquo;ll come and take leave&mdash;?&rdquo; His manner implied that
      the omission would be uncivil, but there seemed to Longmore himself
      something so ludicrous in his taking a lesson in consideration from M. de
      Mauves that he put the appeal by with a laugh. The Count frowned as if it
      were a new and unpleasant sensation for him to be left at a loss. &ldquo;Ah you
      people have your facons!&rdquo; he murmured as Longmore turned away, not
      foreseeing that he should learn still more about his facons before he had
      done with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore sat down to dinner at his hotel with his usual good intentions,
      but in the act of lifting his first glass of wine to his lips he suddenly
      fell to musing and set down the liquor untasted. This mood lasted long,
      and when he emerged from it his fish was cold; but that mattered little,
      for his appetite was gone. That evening he packed his trunk with an
      indignant energy. This was so effective that the operation was
      accomplished before bedtime, and as he was not in the least sleepy he
      devoted the interval to writing two letters, one of them a short note to
      Madame de Mauves, which he entrusted to a servant for delivery the next
      morning. He had found it best, he said, to leave Saint-Germain
      immediately, but he expected to return to Paris early in the autumn. The
      other letter was the result of his having remembered a day or two before
      that he had not yet complied with Mrs. Draper&rsquo;s injunction to give her an
      account of his impression of her friend. The present occasion seemed
      propitious, and he wrote half a dozen pages. His tone, however, was grave,
      and Mrs. Draper, on reading him over, was slightly disappointed&mdash;she
      would have preferred he should have &ldquo;raved&rdquo; a little more. But what
      chiefly concerns us is the concluding passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only time she ever spoke to me of her marriage,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;she
      intimated that it had been a perfect love-match. With all abatements, I
      suppose, this is what most marriages take themselves to be; but it would
      mean in her case, I think, more than in that of most women, for her love
      was an absolute idealisation. She believed her husband to be a hero of
      rose-coloured romance, and he turns out to be not even a hero of very
      sad-coloured reality. For some time now she has been sounding her mistake,
      but I don&rsquo;t believe she has yet touched the bottom. She strikes me as a
      person who&rsquo;s begging off from full knowledge&mdash;who has patched up a
      peace with some painful truth and is trying a while the experiment of
      living with closed eyes. In the dark she tries to see again the gilding on
      her idol. Illusion of course is illusion, and one must always pay for it;
      but there&rsquo;s something truly tragical in seeing an earthly penalty levied
      on such divine folly as this. As for M. de Mauves he&rsquo;s a shallow Frenchman
      to his fingers&rsquo; ends, and I confess I should dislike him for this if he
      were a much better man. He can&rsquo;t forgive his wife for having married him
      too extravagantly and loved him too well; since he feels, I suppose, in
      some uncorrupted corner of his being that as she originally saw him so he
      ought to have been. It disagrees with him somewhere that a little American
      bourgeoise should have fancied him a finer fellow than he is or than he at
      all wants to be. He hasn&rsquo;t a glimmering of real acquaintance with his
      wife; he can&rsquo;t understand the stream of passion flowing so clear and
      still. To tell the truth I hardly understand it myself, but when I see the
      sight I find I greatly admire it. The Count at any rate would have enjoyed
      the comfort of believing his wife as bad a case as himself, and you&rsquo;ll
      hardly believe me when I assure you he goes about intimating to gentlemen
      whom he thinks it may concern that it would be a convenience to him they
      should make love to Madame de Mauves.&rdquo;

      On reaching Paris Longmore straightaway purchased a Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Belgium&rdquo; to
      help himself to believe that he would start on the morrow for Brussels;
      but when the morrow came it occurred to him that he ought by way of
      preparation to acquaint himself more intimately with the Flemish painters
      in the Louvre. This took a whole morning, but it did little to hasten his
      departure. He had abruptly left Saint-Germain because it seemed to him
      that respect for Madame de Mauves required he should bequeath her husband
      no reason to suppose he had, as it were, taken a low hint; but now that he
      had deferred to that scruple he found himself thinking more and more
      ardently of his friend. It was a poor expression of ardour to be lingering
      irresolutely on the forsaken boulevard, but he detested the idea of
      leaving Saint-Germain five hundred miles behind him. He felt very foolish,
      nevertheless, and wandered about nervously, promising himself to take the
      next train. A dozen trains started, however, and he was still in Paris.
      This inward ache was more than he had bargained for, and as he looked at
      the shop-windows he wondered if it represented a &ldquo;passion.&rdquo; He had never
      been fond of the word and had grown up with much mistrust of what it stood
      for. He had hoped that when he should fall &ldquo;really&rdquo; in love he should do
      it with an excellent conscience, with plenty of confidence and joy,
      doubtless, but no strange soreness, no pangs nor regrets. Here was a
      sentiment concocted of pity and anger as well as of admiration, and
      bristling with scruples and doubts and fears. He had come abroad to enjoy
      the Flemish painters and all others, but what fair-tressed saint of Van
      Eyck or Memling was so interesting a figure as the lonely lady of
      Saint-Germain? His restless steps carried him at last out of the long
      villa-bordered avenue which leads to the Bois de Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer had fairly begun and the drive beside the lake was empty, but there
      were various loungers on the benches and chairs, and the great cafe had an
      air of animation. Longmore&rsquo;s walk had given him an appetite, and he went
      into the establishment and demanded a dinner, remarking for the hundredth
      time, as he admired the smart little tables disposed in the open air, how
      much better (than anywhere else) they ordered this matter in France. &ldquo;Will
      monsieur dine in the garden or in the salon?&rdquo; the waiter blandly asked.
      Longmore chose the garden and, observing that a great cluster of June
      roses was trained over the wall of the house, placed himself at a table
      near by, where the best of dinners was served him on the whitest of linen
      and in the most shining of porcelain. It so happened that his table was
      near a window and that as he sat he could look into a corner of the salon.
      So it was that his attention rested on a lady seated just within the
      window, which was open, face to face apparently with a companion who was
      concealed by the curtain. She was a very pretty woman, and Longmore looked
      at her as often as was consistent with good manners. After a while he even
      began to wonder who she was and finally to suspect that she was one of
      those ladies whom it is no breach of good manners to look at as often as
      you like. Our young man too, if he had been so disposed, would have been
      the more free to give her all his attention that her own was fixed upon
      the person facing her. She was what the French call a belle brune, and
      though Longmore, who had rather a conservative taste in such matters, was
      but half-charmed by her bold outlines and even braver complexion, he
      couldn&rsquo;t help admiring her expression of basking contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently very happy, and her happiness gave her an air of
      innocence. The talk of her friend, whoever he was, abundantly suited her
      humour, for she sat listening to him with a broad idle smile and
      interrupting him fitfully, while she crunched her bonbons, with a murmured
      response, presumably as broad, which appeared to have the effect of
      launching him again. She drank a great deal of champagne and ate an
      immense number of strawberries, and was plainly altogether a person with
      an impartial relish for strawberries, champagne and what she doubtless
      would have called betises.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had half-finished dinner when Longmore sat down, and he was still in
      his place when they rose. She had hung her bonnet on a nail above her
      chair, and her companion passed round the table to take it down for her.
      As he did so she bent her head to look at a wine-stain on her dress, and
      in the movement exposed the greater part of the back of a very handsome
      neck. The gentleman observed it, and observed also, apparently, that the
      room beyond them was empty; that he stood within eyeshot of Longmore he
      failed to observe. He stooped suddenly and imprinted a gallant kiss on the
      fair expanse. In the author of this tribute Longmore then recognised
      Richard de Mauves. The lady to whom it had been rendered put on her
      bonnet, using his flushed smile as a mirror, and in a moment they passed
      through the garden on their way to their carriage. Then for the first time
      M. de Mauves became aware of his wife&rsquo;s young friend. He measured with a
      rapid glance this spectator&rsquo;s relation to the open window and checked
      himself in the impulse to stop and speak to him. He contented himself with
      bowing all imperturbably as he opened the gate for his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Longmore made a railway journey, but not to Brussels. He had
      effectually ceased to care for Brussels; all he cared for in the world now
      was Madame de Mauves. The air of his mind had had a sudden clearing-up;
      pity and anger were still throbbing there, but they had space to range at
      their pleasure, for doubts and scruples had abruptly departed. It was
      little, he felt, that he could interpose between her resignation and the
      indignity of her position; but that little, if it involved the sacrifice
      of everything that bound him to the tranquil past, he could offer her with
      a rapture which at last made stiff resistance a terribly inferior
      substitute for faith. Nothing in his tranquil past had given such a zest
      to consciousness as this happy sense of choosing to go straight back to
      Saint-Germain. How to justify his return, how to explain his ardour,
      troubled him little. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure he wished to be understood; he
      wished only to show how little by any fault of his Madame de Mauves was
      alone so with the harshness of fate. He was conscious of no distinct
      desire to &ldquo;make love&rdquo; to her; if he could have uttered the essence of his
      longing he would have said that he wished her to remember that in a world
      coloured grey to her vision by the sense of her mistake there was one
      vividly honest man. She might certainly have remembered it, however,
      without his coming back to remind her; and it is not to be denied that as
      he waited for the morrow he longed immensely for the sound of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited the next day till his usual hour of calling&mdash;the late
      afternoon; but he learned at the door that the mistress of the house was
      not at home. The servant offered the information that she was walking a
      little way in the forest. Longmore went through the garden and out of the
      small door into the lane, and, after half an hour&rsquo;s vain exploration, saw
      her coming toward him at the end of a green by-path. As he appeared she
      stopped a moment, as if to turn aside; then recognising him she slowly
      advanced and had presently taken the hand he held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has happened,&rdquo; she said with her beautiful eyes on him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      not ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing except that when I got to Paris I found how fond I had grown of
      Saint-Germain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She neither smiled nor looked flattered; it seemed indeed to Longmore that
      she took his reappearance with no pleasure. But he was uncertain, for he
      immediately noted that in his absence the whole character of her face had
      changed. It showed him something momentous had happened. It was no longer
      self-contained melancholy that he read in her eyes, but grief and
      agitation which had lately struggled with the passionate love of peace
      ruling her before all things else, and forced her to know that deep
      experience is never peaceful. She was pale and had evidently been shedding
      tears. He felt his heart beat hard&mdash;he seemed now to touch her
      secret. She continued to look at him with a clouded brow, as if his return
      had surrounded her with complications too great to be disguised by a
      colourless welcome. For some moments, as he turned and walked beside her,
      neither spoke; then abruptly, &ldquo;Tell me truly, Mr. Longmore,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;why you&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo; He inclined himself to her, almost pulling up
      again, with an air that startled her into a certainty of what she had
      feared. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve learned the real answer to the question I asked you
      the other day. You&rsquo;re not happy&mdash;you&rsquo;re too good to be happy on the
      terms offered you. Madame de Mauves,&rdquo; he went on with a gesture which
      protested against a gesture of her own, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be happy, you know, when
      you&rsquo;re as little so as I make you out. I don&rsquo;t care for anything so long
      as I only feel helpless and sore about you. I found during those dreary
      days in Paris that the thing in life I most care for is this daily
      privilege of seeing you. I know it&rsquo;s very brutal to tell you I admire you;
      it&rsquo;s an insult to you to treat you as if you had complained to me or
      appealed to me. But such a friendship as I waked up to there&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      tossed his head toward the distant city&mdash;&ldquo;is a potent force, I assure
      you. When forces are stupidly stifled they explode. However,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;if you had told me every trouble in your heart it would have mattered
      little; I couldn&rsquo;t say more than I&mdash;that if that in life from which
      you&rsquo;ve hoped most has given you least, this devoted respect of mine will
      refuse no service and betray no trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to make marks in the earth with the point of her parasol,
      but she stopped and listened to him in perfect immobility&mdash;immobility
      save for the appearance by the time he had stopped speaking of a flush in
      her guarded clearness. Such as it was it told Longmore she was moved, and
      his first perceiving it was the happiest moment of his life. She raised
      her eyes at last, and they uttered a plea for non-insistence that
      unspeakably touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you!&rdquo; she said calmly enough; but the next moment
      her own emotion baffled this pretence, a convulsion shook her for ten
      seconds and she burst into tears. Her tears vanished as quickly as they
      came, but they did Longmore a world of good. He had always felt
      indefinably afraid of her; her being had somehow seemed fed by a deeper
      faith and a stronger will than his own; but her half-dozen smothered sobs
      showed him the bottom of her heart and convinced him she was weak enough
      to be grateful. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too nervous to listen to you.
      I believe I could have dealt with an enemy to-day, but I can&rsquo;t bear up
      under a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing yourself with stoicism&mdash;that&rsquo;s what is the matter
      with you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Listen to a friend for his own sake if not for
      yours. I&rsquo;ve never presumed to offer you an atom of compassion, and you
      can&rsquo;t accuse yourself of an abuse of charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her as under the constraint of this appeal, but it
      promised him a reluctant attention. Noting, however, by the wayside the
      fallen log on which they had rested a few evenings before, she went and
      sat down on it with a resigned grace while the young man, silent before
      her and watching her, took from her the mute assurance that if she was
      charitable now he must at least be very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something came to my knowledge yesterday,&rdquo; he said as he sat down beside
      her, &ldquo;which gave me an intense impression of your loneliness. You&rsquo;re truth
      itself, and there&rsquo;s no truth about you. You believe in purity and duty and
      dignity, and you live in a world in which they&rsquo;re daily belied. I ask
      myself with vain rage how you ever came into such a world, and why the
      perversity of fate never let me know you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a little; she looked down, straight before her. &ldquo;I like my
      &lsquo;world&rsquo; no better than you do, and it was not for its own sake I came into
      it. But what particular group of people is worth pinning one&rsquo;s faith upon?
      I confess it sometimes seems to me men and women are very poor creatures.
      I suppose I&rsquo;m too romantic and always was. I&rsquo;ve an unfortunate taste for
      poetic fitness. Life&rsquo;s hard prose, and one must learn to read prose
      contentedly. I believe I once supposed all the prose to be in America,
      which was very foolish. What I thought, what I believed, what I expected,
      when I was an ignorant girl fatally addicted to falling in love with my
      own theories, is more than I can begin to tell you now. Sometimes when I
      remember certain impulses, certain illusions of those days they take away
      my breath, and I wonder that my false point of view hasn&rsquo;t led me into
      troubles greater than any I&rsquo;ve now to lament. I had a conviction which
      you&rsquo;d probably smile at if I were to attempt to express it to you. It was
      a singular form for passionate faith to take, but it had all of the
      sweetness and the ardour of passionate faith. It led me to take a great
      step, and it lies behind me now, far off, a vague deceptive form melting
      in the light of experience. It has faded, but it hasn&rsquo;t vanished. Some
      feelings, I&rsquo;m sure, die only with ourselves; some illusions are as much
      the condition of our life as our heart-beats. They say that life itself is
      an illusion&mdash;that this world is a shadow of which the reality is yet
      to come. Life is all of a piece then and there&rsquo;s no shame in being
      miserably human. As for my loneliness, it doesn&rsquo;t greatly matter; it is
      the fault in part of my obstinacy. There have been times when I&rsquo;ve been
      frantically distressed and, to tell you the truth, wretchedly homesick,
      because my maid&mdash;a jewel of a maid&mdash;lied to me with every second
      breath. There have been moments when I&rsquo;ve wished I was the daughter of a
      poor New England minister&mdash;living in a little white house under a
      couple of elms and doing all the housework.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to speak slowly, with reserve and effort; but she went on
      quickly and as if talk were at last a relief. &ldquo;My marriage introduced me
      to people and things which seemed to me at first very strange and then
      very horrible, and then, to tell the truth, of very little importance. At
      first I expended a great deal of sorrow and dismay and pity on it all; but
      there soon came a time when I began to wonder if it were worth one&rsquo;s
      tears. If I could tell you the eternal friendships I&rsquo;ve seen broken, the
      inconsolable woes consoled, the jealousies and vanities scrambling to
      outdo each other, you&rsquo;d agree with me that tempers like yours and mine can
      understand neither such troubles nor such compensations. A year ago, while
      I was in the country, a friend of mine was in despair at the infidelity of
      her husband; she wrote me a most dolorous letter, and on my return to
      Paris I went immediately to see her. A week had elapsed, and as I had seen
      stranger things I thought she might have recovered her spirits. Not at
      all; she was still in despair&mdash;but at what? At the conduct, the
      abandoned, shameless conduct of&mdash;well of a lady I&rsquo;ll call Madame de
      T. You&rsquo;ll imagine of course that Madame de T. was the lady whom my
      friend&rsquo;s husband preferred to his wife. Far from it; he had never seen
      her. Who then was Madame de T.? Madame de T. was cruelly devoted to M. de
      V. And who was M. de V.? M. de V. was&mdash;well, in two words again, my
      friend was cultivating two jealousies at once. I hardly know what I said
      to her; something at any rate that she found unpardonable, for she quite
      gave me up. Shortly afterwards my husband proposed we should cease to live
      in Paris, and I gladly assented, for I believe I had taken a turn of
      spirits that made me a detestable companion. I should have preferred to go
      quite into the country, into Auvergne, where my husband has a house. But
      to him Paris in some degree is necessary, and Saint-Germain has been a
      conscious compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conscious compromise!&rdquo; Longmore expressively repeated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your
      whole life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the life of many people,&rdquo; she made prompt answer&mdash;&ldquo;of most
      people of quiet tastes, and it&rsquo;s certainly better than acute distress.
      One&rsquo;s at a loss theoretically to defend compromises; but if I found a poor
      creature who had managed to arrive at one I should think myself not
      urgently called to expose its weak side.&rdquo; But she had no sooner uttered
      these words than she laughed all amicably, as if to mitigate their too
      personal application.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid one should do that unless one has something better to
      offer,&rdquo; Longmore returned. &ldquo;And yet I&rsquo;m haunted by the dream of a life in
      which you should have found no compromises, for they&rsquo;re a perversion of
      natures that tend only to goodness and rectitude. As I see it you should
      have found happiness serene, profound, complete; a femme de chambre not a
      jewel perhaps, but warranted to tell but one fib a day; a society possibly
      rather provincial, but&mdash;in spite of your poor opinion of mankind&mdash;a
      good deal of solid virtue; jealousies and vanities very tame, and no
      particular iniquities and adulteries. A husband,&rdquo; he added after a moment&mdash;&ldquo;a
      husband of your own faith and race and spiritual substance, who would have
      loved you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet, shaking her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind to go to the
      expense of such dazzling visions for me. Visions are vain things; we must
      make the best of the reality we happen to be in for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Longmore, provoked by what seemed the very wantonness of
      her patience, &ldquo;the reality YOU &lsquo;happen to be in for&rsquo; has, if I&rsquo;m not in
      error, very recently taken a shape that keenly tests your philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed on the point of replying that his sympathy was too zealous; but
      a couple of impatient tears in his eyes proved it founded on a devotion of
      which she mightn&rsquo;t make light. &ldquo;Ah philosophy?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;I HAVE none.
      Thank heaven,&rdquo; she cried with vehemence, &ldquo;I have none! I believe, Mr.
      Longmore,&rdquo; she added in a moment, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve nothing on earth but a
      conscience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good time to tell you so&mdash;nothing but a
      dogged obstinate clinging conscience. Does that prove me to be indeed of
      your faith and race, and have you one yourself for which you can say as
      much? I don&rsquo;t speak in vanity, for I believe that if my conscience may
      prevent me from doing anything very base it will effectually prevent me
      also from doing anything very fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it,&rdquo; her friend returned with high emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;that
      proves we&rsquo;re made for each other. It&rsquo;s very certain I too shall never cut
      a great romantic figure. And yet I&rsquo;ve fancied that in my case the
      unaccommodating organ we speak of might be blinded and gagged a while, in
      a really good cause, if not turned out of doors. In yours,&rdquo; he went on
      with the same appealing irony, &ldquo;is it absolutely beyond being &lsquo;squared&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she made no concession to his tone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at your conscience,&rdquo;
       she answered gravely; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only blasphemy I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly spoken when she turned suddenly at an unexpected sound, and
      at the same moment he heard a footstep in an adjacent by-path which
      crossed their own at a short distance from where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s M. de Mauves,&rdquo; she said at once; with which she moved slowly
      forward. Longmore, wondering how she knew without seeing, had overtaken
      her by the time her husband came into view. A solitary walk in the forest
      was a pastime to which M. de Mauves was not addicted, but he seemed on
      this occasion to have resorted to it with some equanimity. He was smoking
      a fragrant cigar and had thrust his thumb into the armhole of his
      waistcoat with the air of a man thinking at his ease. He stopped short
      with surprise on seeing his wife and her companion, and his surprise had
      for Longmore even the pitch of impertinence. He glanced rapidly from one
      to the other, fixed the young man&rsquo;s own look sharply a single instant and
      then lifted his hat with formal politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; he said, turning to Madame de Mauves, &ldquo;that I might
      congratulate you on the return of monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should at once have known it,&rdquo; she immediately answered, &ldquo;if I had
      expected such a pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned very pale, and Longmore felt this to be a first meeting
      after some commotion. &ldquo;My return was unexpected to myself,&rdquo; he said to her
      husband. &ldquo;I came back last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves seemed to express such satisfaction as could consort with a
      limited interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s needless for me to make you welcome. Madame de
      Mauves knows the duties of hospitality.&rdquo; And with another bow he continued
      his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pursued her homeward course with her friend, neither of them
      pretending much not to consent to appear silent. The Count&rsquo;s few moments
      with them had both chilled Longmore and angered him, casting a shadow
      across a prospect which had somehow, just before, begun to open and almost
      to brighten. He watched his companion narrowly as they went, and wondered
      what she had last had to suffer. Her husband&rsquo;s presence had checked her
      disposition to talk, though nothing betrayed she had recognised his making
      a point at her expense. Yet if matters were none the less plainly at a
      crisis between them he could but wonder vainly what it was on her part
      that prevented some practical protest or some rupture. What did she
      suspect?&mdash;how much did she know? To what was she resigned?&mdash;how
      much had she forgiven? How, above all, did she reconcile with knowledge,
      or with suspicion, that intense consideration she had just now all but
      assured him she entertained? &ldquo;She has loved him once,&rdquo; Longmore said with
      a sinking of the heart, &ldquo;and with her to love once is to commit herself
      for ever. Her clever husband thinks her too prim. What would a stupid poet
      call it?&rdquo; He relapsed with aching impotence into the sense of her being
      somehow beyond him, unattainable, immeasurable by his own fretful logic.
      Suddenly he gave three passionate switches in the air with his cane which
      made Madame de Mauves look round. She could hardly have guessed their
      signifying that where ambition was so vain the next best thing to it was
      the very ardour of hopelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found in her drawing-room the little elderly Frenchman, M. de
      Chalumeau, whom Longmore had observed a few days before on the terrace. On
      this occasion too Madame Clairin was entertaining him, but as her
      sister-in-law came in she surrendered her post and addressed herself to
      our hero. Longmore, at thirty, was still an ingenuous youth, and there was
      something in this lady&rsquo;s large assured attack that fairly intimidated him.
      He was doubtless not as reassured as he ought to have been at finding he
      had not absolutely forfeited her favour by his want of resource during
      their last interview, and a suspicion of her being prepared to approach
      him on another line completed his distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve returned from Brussels by way of the forest?&rdquo; she archly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been to Brussels. I returned yesterday from Paris by the only
      way&mdash;by the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin was infinitely struck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known a person at all to
      be so fond of Saint-Germain. They generally declare it&rsquo;s horribly dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very polite to you,&rdquo; said Longmore, vexed at his lack of
      superior form and determined not to be abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah what have I to do with it?&rdquo; Madame Clairin brightly wailed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
      dullest thing here. They&rsquo;ve not had, other gentlemen, your success with my
      sister-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been very easy to have it. Madame de Mauves is kindness
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung open her great fan. &ldquo;To her own countrymen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore remained silent; he hated the tone of this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker looked at him a little and then took in their hostess, to whom
      M. de Chalumeau was serving up another epigram, which the charming
      creature received with a droop of the head and eyes that strayed through
      the window. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend to tell me,&rdquo; Madame Clairin suddenly exhaled,
      &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not in love with that pretty woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allons donc!&rdquo; cried Longmore in the most inspired French he had ever
      uttered. He rose the next minute and took a hasty farewell.

    </h2>
    <p>
      He allowed several days to pass without going back; it was of a sublime
      suitability to appear to regard his friend&rsquo;s frankness during their last
      interview as a general invitation. The sacrifice cost him a great effort,
      for hopeless passions are exactly not the most patient; and he had
      moreover a constant fear that if, as he believed, deep within the circle
      round which he could only hover, the hour of supreme explanations had
      come, the magic of her magnanimity might convert M. de Mauves. Vicious
      men, it was abundantly recorded, had been so converted as to be acceptable
      to God, and the something divine in this lady&rsquo;s composition would sanctify
      any means she should choose to employ. Her means, he kept repeating, were
      no business of his, and the essence of his admiration ought to be to allow
      her to do as she liked; but he felt as if he should turn away into a world
      out of which most of the joy had departed if she should like, after all,
      to see nothing more in his interest in her than might be repaid by mere
      current social coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he went back he found to his vexation that he was to run the
      gauntlet of Madame Clairin&rsquo;s officious hospitality. It was one of the
      first mornings of perfect summer, and the drawing-room, through the open
      windows, was flooded with such a confusion of odours and bird-notes as
      might warrant the hope that Madame de Mauves would renew with him for an
      hour or two the exploration of the forest. Her sister-in-law, however,
      whose hair was not yet dressed, emerged like a brassy discord in a maze of
      melody. At the same moment the servant returned with his mistress&rsquo;s
      regrets; she begged to be excused, she was indisposed and unable to see
      Mr. Longmore. The young man knew just how disappointed he looked and just
      what Madame Clairin thought of it, and this consciousness determined in
      him an attitude of almost aggressive frigidity. This was apparently what
      she desired. She wished to throw him off his balance and, if she was not
      mistaken, knew exactly how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down your hat, Mr. Longmore,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and be polite for once. You
      were not at all polite the other day when I asked you that friendly
      question about the state of your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVE no heart&mdash;to talk about,&rdquo; he returned with as little grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well say you&rsquo;ve none at all. I advise you to cultivate a little
      eloquence; you may have use for it. That was not an idle question of mine;
      I don&rsquo;t ask idle questions. For a couple of months now that you&rsquo;ve been
      coming and going among us it seems to me you&rsquo;ve had very few to answer of
      any sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve certainly been very well treated,&rdquo; he still dryly allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion waited ever so little to bring out: &ldquo;Have you never felt
      disposed to ask any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her look, her tone, were so charged with insidious meanings as to make him
      feel that even to understand her would savour of dishonest complicity.
      &ldquo;What is it you have to tell me?&rdquo; he cried with a flushed frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own colour rose at the question. It&rsquo;s rather hard, when you come
      bearing yourself very much as the sibyl when she came to the Roman king,
      to be treated as something worse than a vulgar gossip. &ldquo;I might tell you,
      monsieur,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve as bad a ton as any young man I ever
      met. Where have you lived&mdash;what are your ideas? A stupid one of my
      own&mdash;possibly!&mdash;has been to call your attention to a fact that
      it takes some delicacy to touch upon. You&rsquo;ve noticed, I suppose, that my
      sister-in-law isn&rsquo;t the happiest woman in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;Longmore made short work of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to measure his intelligence a little uncertainly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      formed, I suppose,&rdquo; she nevertheless continued, &ldquo;your conception of the
      grounds of her discontent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t required much forming. The grounds&mdash;or at least a specimen
      or two of them&mdash;have simply stared me in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin considered a moment with her eyes on him. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;ces
      choses-la se voient. My brother, in a single word, has the deplorable
      habit of falling in love with other women. I don&rsquo;t judge him; I don&rsquo;t
      judge my sister-in-law. I only permit myself to say that in her position I
      would have managed otherwise. I&rsquo;d either have kept my husband&rsquo;s affection
      or I&rsquo;d have frankly done without it. But my sister&rsquo;s an odd compound; I
      don&rsquo;t profess to understand her. Therefore it is, in a measure, that I
      appeal to you, her fellow countryman. Of course you&rsquo;ll be surprised at my
      way of looking at the matter, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a way in use only
      among people whose history&mdash;that of a race&mdash;has cultivated in
      them the sense for high political solutions.&rdquo; She paused and Longmore
      wondered where the history of her race was going to lead her. But she
      clearly saw her course. &ldquo;There has never been a galant homme among us, I
      fear, who has not given his wife, even when she was very charming, the
      right to be jealous. We know our history for ages back, and the fact&rsquo;s
      established. It&rsquo;s not a very edifying one if you like, but it&rsquo;s something
      to have scandals with pedigrees&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t have them with
      attenuations. Our men have been Frenchmen of France, and their wives&mdash;I
      may say it&mdash;have been of no meaner blood. You may see all their
      portraits at our poor charming old house&mdash;every one of them an
      &lsquo;injured&rsquo; beauty, but not one of them hanging her head. Not one of them
      ever had the bad taste to be jealous, and yet not one in a dozen ever
      consented to an indiscretion&mdash;allowed herself, I mean, to be talked
      about. Voila comme elles ont su s&rsquo;arranger. How they did it&mdash;go and
      look at the dusky faded canvases and pastels and ask. They were dear brave
      women of wit. When they had a headache they put on a little rouge and came
      to supper as usual, and when they had a heart-ache they touched up that
      quarter with just such another brush. These are great traditions and
      charming precedents, I hold, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me fair that a little
      American bourgeoise should come in and pretend to alter them&mdash;all to
      hang her modern photograph and her obstinate little air penche in the
      gallery of our shrewd great-grandmothers. She should fall into line, she
      should keep up the tone. When she married my brother I don&rsquo;t suppose she
      took him for a member of a societe de bonnes oeuvres. I don&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re
      right; who IS right? But we are as history has made us, and if any one&rsquo;s
      to change it had better be our charming, but not accommodating, friend.&rdquo;
       Again Madame Clairin paused, again she opened and closed her great modern
      fan, which clattered like the screen of a shop-window. &ldquo;Let her keep up
      the tone!&rdquo; she prodigiously repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore felt himself gape, but he gasped an &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; to cover it. Madame
      Clairin&rsquo;s dip into the family annals had apparently imparted an honest
      zeal to her indignation. &ldquo;For a long time,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;my belle-soeur
      has been taking the attitude of an injured woman, affecting a disgust with
      the world and shutting herself up to read free-thinking books. I&rsquo;ve never
      permitted myself, you may believe, the least observation on her conduct,
      but I can&rsquo;t accept it as the last word either of taste or of tact. When a
      woman with her prettiness lets her husband stray away she deserves no
      small part of her fate. I don&rsquo;t wish you to agree with me&mdash;on the
      contrary; but I call such a woman a pure noodle. She must have bored him
      to death. What has passed between them for many months needn&rsquo;t concern us;
      what provocation my sister has had&mdash;monstrous, if you wish&mdash;what
      ennui my brother has suffered. It&rsquo;s enough that a week ago, just after you
      had ostensibly gone to Brussels, something happened to produce an
      explosion. She found a letter in his pocket, a photograph, a trinket, que
      sais-je? At any rate there was a grand scene. I didn&rsquo;t listen at the
      keyhole, and I don&rsquo;t know what was said; but I&rsquo;ve reason to believe that
      my poor brother was hauled over the coals as I fancy none of his ancestors
      have ever been&mdash;even by angry ladies who weren&rsquo;t their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore had leaned forward in silent attention with his elbows on his
      knees, and now, impulsively, he dropped his face into his hands. &ldquo;Ah poor
      poor woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voila!&rdquo; said Madame Clairin. &ldquo;You pity her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity her?&rdquo; cried Longmore, looking up with ardent eyes and forgetting the
      spirit of the story to which he had been treated in the miserable facts.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. But I&rsquo;m not acting sentimentally&mdash;I&rsquo;m acting
      scientifically. We&rsquo;ve always been capable of ideas. I want to arrange
      things; to see my brother free to do as he chooses; to see his wife
      contented. Do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I think,&rdquo; the young man said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most immoral person
      I&rsquo;ve lately had the privilege of conversing with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin took it calmly. &ldquo;Possibly. When was ever a great peacemaker
      not immoral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah no,&rdquo; Longmore protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too superficial to be a great
      peacemaker. You don&rsquo;t begin to know anything about Madame de Mauves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head to one side while her fine eyes kept her visitor in
      view; she mused a moment and then smiled as with a certain compassionate
      patience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in my interest to contradict you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be in your interest to learn, madam&rdquo; he resolutely returned,
      &ldquo;what honest men most admire in a woman&mdash;and to recognise it when you
      see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was wonderful&mdash;she waited a moment. &ldquo;So you ARE in love!&rdquo; she
      then effectively brought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he thought of getting up, but he decided to stay. &ldquo;I wonder
      if you&rsquo;d understand me,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;if I were to tell you that I
      have for Madame de Mauves the most devoted and most respectful
      friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You underrate my intelligence. But in that case you ought to exert your
      influence to put an end to these painful domestic scenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine she talks to me about her domestic scenes?&rdquo; Longmore
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion stared. &ldquo;Then your friendship isn&rsquo;t returned?&rdquo; And as he but
      ambiguously threw up his hands, &ldquo;Now, at least,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll have
      something to tell you. I happen to know the upshot of my brother&rsquo;s last
      interview with his wife.&rdquo; Longmore rose to his feet as a protest against
      the indelicacy of the position into which he had been drawn; but all that
      made him tender made him curious, and she caught in his averted eyes an
      expression that prompted her to strike her blow. &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s absurdly
      entangled with a certain person in Paris; of course he ought not to be,
      but he wouldn&rsquo;t be my brother if he weren&rsquo;t. It was this irregular passion
      that dictated his words. &lsquo;Listen to me, madam,&rsquo; he cried at last; &lsquo;let us
      live like people who understand life! It&rsquo;s unpleasant to be forced to say
      such things outright, but you&rsquo;ve a way of bringing one down to the
      rudiments. I&rsquo;m faithless, I&rsquo;m heartless, I&rsquo;m brutal, I&rsquo;m everything
      horrible&mdash;it&rsquo;s understood. Take your revenge, console yourself:
      you&rsquo;re too charming a woman to have anything to complain of. Here&rsquo;s a
      handsome young man sighing himself into a consumption for you. Listen to
      your poor compatriot and you&rsquo;ll find that virtue&rsquo;s none the less becoming
      for being good-natured. You&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s not after all such a doleful
      world and that there&rsquo;s even an advantage in having the most impudent of
      husbands.&rdquo;&rsquo; Madame Clairin paused; Longmore had turned very pale. &ldquo;You may
      believe it,&rdquo; she amazingly pursued; &ldquo;the speech took place in my presence;
      things were done in order. And now, monsieur&rdquo;&mdash;this with a wondrous
      strained grimace which he was too troubled at the moment to appreciate,
      but which he remembered later with a kind of awe&mdash;&ldquo;we count on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband said this to her face to face, as you say it to me now?&rdquo; he
      asked after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word for word and with the most perfect politeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Madame de Mauves&mdash;what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin smiled again. &ldquo;To such a speech as that a woman says&mdash;nothing.
      She had been sitting with a piece of needlework, and I think she hadn&rsquo;t
      seen Richard since their quarrel the day before. He came in with the
      gravity of an ambassador, and I&rsquo;m sure that when he made his demande en
      mariage his manner wasn&rsquo;t more respectful. He only wanted white gloves!&rdquo;
       said Longmore&rsquo;s friend. &ldquo;My belle-soeur sat silent a few moments, drawing
      her stitches, and then without a word, without a glance, walked out of the
      room. It was just what she SHOULD have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the young man repeated, &ldquo;it was just what she should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, left alone with my brother, do you know what I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mauvals sujet!&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done me the honour,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to take this step in my presence. I
      don&rsquo;t pretend to qualify it. You know what you&rsquo;re about, and it&rsquo;s your own
      affair. But you may confide in my discretion.&rsquo; Do you think he has had
      reason to complain of it?&rdquo; She received no answer; her visitor had slowly
      averted himself; he passed his gloves mechanically round the band of his
      hat. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to start for Brussels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plainly he was much disturbed, and Madame Clairin might congratulate
      herself on the success of her plea for old-fashioned manners. And yet
      there was something that left her more puzzled than satisfied in the
      colourless tone with which he answered, &ldquo;No, I shall remain here for the
      present.&rdquo; The processes of his mind were unsociably private, and she could
      have fancied for a moment that he was linked with their difficult friend
      in some monstrous conspiracy of asceticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this evening,&rdquo; she nevertheless bravely resumed. &ldquo;The rest will take
      care of itself. Meanwhile I shall take the liberty of telling my
      sister-in-law that I&rsquo;ve repeated&mdash;in short, that I&rsquo;ve put you au
      fait&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a start but he controlled himself, speaking quietly enough. &ldquo;Tell
      her what you please. Nothing you can tell her will affect her conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voyons! Do you mean to tell me that a woman young, pretty, sentimental,
      neglected, wronged if you will&mdash;? I see you don&rsquo;t believe it. Believe
      simply in your own opportunity!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But for heaven&rsquo;s sake, if
      it is to lead anywhere, don&rsquo;t come back with that visage de croquemort.
      You look as if you were going to bury your heart&mdash;not to offer it to
      a pretty woman. You&rsquo;re much better when you smile&mdash;you&rsquo;re very nice
      then. Come, do yourself justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained a moment face to face with her, but his expression didn&rsquo;t
      change. &ldquo;I shall do myself justice,&rdquo; he however after an instant made
      answer; and abruptly, with a bow, he took his departure.

    <p>
      He felt, when he found himself unobserved and outside, that he must plunge
      into violent action, walk fast and far and defer the opportunity for
      thought. He strode away into the forest, swinging his cane, throwing back
      his head, casting his eyes into verdurous vistas and following the road
      without a purpose. He felt immensely excited, but could have given no
      straight name to his agitation. It was a joy as all increase of freedom is
      joyous; something seemed to have been cleared out of his path and his
      destiny to have rounded a cape and brought him into sight of an open sea.
      But it was a pain in the degree in which his freedom somehow resolved
      itself into the need of despising all mankind with a single exception; and
      the fact that Madame de Mauves inhabited a planet contaminated by the
      presence of the baser multitude kept elation from seeming a pledge of
      ideal bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she was, at any rate, and circumstances now forced them to be
      intimate. She had ceased to have what men call a secret for him, and this
      fact itself brought with it a sort of rapture. He had no prevision that he
      should &ldquo;profit,&rdquo; in the vulgar sense, by the extraordinary position into
      which they had been thrown; it might be but a cruel trick of destiny to
      make hope a harsher mockery and renunciation a keener suffering. But above
      all this rose the conviction that she could do nothing that wouldn&rsquo;t
      quicken his attachment. It was this conviction that gross accident&mdash;all
      odious in itself&mdash;would force the beauty of her character into more
      perfect relief for him that made him stride along as if he were
      celebrating a spiritual feast. He rambled at hazard for a couple of hours,
      finding at last that he had left the forest behind him and had wandered
      into an unfamiliar region. It was a perfectly rural scene, and the still
      summer day gave it a charm for which its meagre elements but half
      accounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he had never seen anything so characteristically French; all
      the French novels seemed to have described it, all the French landscapists
      to have painted it. The fields and trees were of a cool metallic green;
      the grass looked as if it might stain his trousers and the foliage his
      hands. The clear light had a mild greyness, the sheen of silver, not of
      gold, was in the work-a-day sun. A great red-roofed high-stacked
      farmhouse, with whitewashed walls and a straggling yard, surveyed the
      highroad, on one side, from behind a transparent curtain of poplars. A
      narrow stream half-choked with emerald rushes and edged with grey aspens
      occupied the opposite quarter. The meadows rolled and sloped away gently
      to the low horizon, which was barely concealed by the continuous line of
      clipped and marshalled trees. The prospect was not rich, but had a frank
      homeliness that touched the young man&rsquo;s fancy. It was full of light
      atmosphere and diffused clearness, and if it was prosaic it was somehow
      sociable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore was disposed to walk further, and he advanced along the road
      beneath the poplars. In twenty minutes he came to a village which
      straggled away to the right, among orchards and potagers. On the left, at
      a stone&rsquo;s throw from the road, stood a little pink-faced inn which
      reminded him that he had not breakfasted, having left home with a
      prevision of hospitality from Madame de Mauves. In the inn he found a
      brick-tiled parlour and a hostess in sabots and a white cap, whom, over
      the omelette she speedily served him&mdash;borrowing licence from the
      bottle of sound red wine that accompanied it&mdash;he assured she was a
      true artist. To reward his compliment she invited him to smoke his cigar
      in her little garden behind the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he found a tonnelle and a view of tinted crops stretching down to the
      stream. The tonnelle was rather close, and he preferred to lounge on a
      bench against the pink wall, in the sun, which was not too hot. Here, as
      he rested and gazed and mused, he fell into a train of thought which, in
      an indefinable fashion, was a soft influence from the scene about him. His
      heart, which had been beating fast for the past three hours, gradually
      checked its pulses and left him looking at life with rather a more level
      gaze. The friendly tavern sounds coming out through the open windows, the
      sunny stillness of the yellowing grain which covered so much vigorous
      natural life, conveyed no strained nor high-pitched message, had little to
      say about renunciation&mdash;nothing at all about spiritual zeal. They
      communicated the sense of plain ripe nature, expressed the unperverted
      reality of things, declared that the common lot isn&rsquo;t brilliantly amusing
      and that the part of wisdom is to grasp frankly at experience lest you
      miss it altogether. What reason there was for his beginning to wonder
      after this whether a deeply-wounded heart might be soothed and healed by
      such a scene, it would be difficult to explain; certain it was that as he
      sat there he dreamt, awake, of an unhappy woman who strolled by the
      slow-flowing stream before him and who pulled down the fruit-laden boughs
      in the orchards. He mused and mused, and at last found himself quite angry
      that he couldn&rsquo;t somehow think worse of Madame de Mauves&mdash;or at any
      rate think otherwise. He could fairly claim that in the romantic way he
      asked very little of life&mdash;made modest demands on passion: why then
      should his only passion be born to ill fortune? Why should his first&mdash;his
      last&mdash;glimpse of positive happiness be so indissolubly linked with
      renunciation?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps because, like many spirits of the same stock, he had in his
      composition a lurking principle of sacrifice, sacrifice for sacrifice&rsquo;s
      sake, to the authority of which he had ever paid due deference, that he
      now felt all the vehemence of rebellion. To renounce, to renounce again,
      to renounce for ever, was this all that youth and longing and ardour were
      meant for? Was experience to be muffled and mutilated like an indecent
      picture? Was a man to sit and deliberately condemn his future to be the
      blank memory of a regret rather than the long possession of a treasure?
      Sacrifice? The word was a trap for minds muddled by fear, an ignoble
      refuge of weakness. To insist now seemed not to dare, but simply to BE, to
      live on possible terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hostess came out to hang a moist cloth on the hedge, and, though her
      guest was sitting quietly enough, she might have imagined in his kindled
      eyes a flattering testimony to the quality of her wine. As she turned back
      into the house she was met by a young man of whom Longmore took note in
      spite of his high distraction. He was evidently a member of that jovial
      fraternity of artists whose very shabbiness has an affinity with the
      unestablished and unexpected in life&mdash;the element often gazed at with
      a certain wistfulness out of the curtained windows even of the highest
      respectability. Longmore was struck first with his looking like a very
      clever man and then with his looking like a contented one. The
      combination, as it was expressed in his face, might have arrested the
      attention of a less exasperated reasoner. He had a slouched hat and a
      yellow beard, a light easel under one arm, and an unfinished sketch in
      oils under the other. He stopped and stood talking for some moments to the
      landlady, while something pleasant played in his face. They were
      discussing the possibilities of dinner; the hostess enumerated some very
      savoury ones, and he nodded briskly, assenting to everything. It couldn&rsquo;t
      be, Longmore thought, that he found such ideal ease in the prospect of
      lamb-chops and spinach and a croute aux fruits. When the dinner had been
      ordered he turned up his sketch, and the good woman fell to admiring and
      comparing, to picking up, off by the stream-side, the objects represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it his work, Longmore wondered, that made him so happy? Was a strong
      talent the best thing in the world? The landlady went back to her kitchen,
      and the young painter stood, as if he were waiting for something, beside
      the gate which opened upon the path across the fields. Longmore sat
      brooding and asking himself if it weren&rsquo;t probably better to cultivate the
      arts than to cultivate the passions. Before he had answered the question
      the painter had grown tired of waiting. He had picked up a pebble, tossed
      it lightly into an upper window and called familiarly &ldquo;Claudine!&rdquo; Claudine
      appeared; Longmore heard her at the window, bidding the young man
      cultivate patience. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m losing my light,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I must have my
      shadows in the same place as yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go without me then,&rdquo; Claudine answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in ten minutes.&rdquo;
       Her voice was fresh and young; it represented almost aggressively to
      Longmore that she was as pleased as her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the Chenier,&rdquo; cried the young man, who, turning away, passed
      out of the gate and followed the path across the fields until he
      disappeared among the trees by the side of the stream. Who might Claudine
      be? Longmore vaguely wondered; and was she as pretty as her voice? Before
      long he had a chance to satisfy himself; she came out of the house with
      her hat and parasol, prepared to follow her companion. She had on a pink
      muslin dress and a little white hat, and she was as pretty as suffices
      almost any Frenchwoman to be pleasing. She had a clear brown skin and a
      bright dark eye and a step that made walking as light a matter as being
      blown&mdash;and this even though she happened to be at the moment not a
      little over-weighted. Her hands were encumbered with various articles
      involved in her pursuit of her friend. In one arm she held her parasol and
      a large roll of needlework, and in the other a shawl and a heavy white
      umbrella, such as painters use for sketching. Meanwhile she was trying to
      thrust into her pocket a paper-covered volume which Longmore saw to be the
      poems of Andre Chenier, and in the effort dropping the large umbrella and
      marking this with a half-smiled exclamation of disgust. Longmore stepped
      forward and picked up the umbrella, and as she, protesting her gratitude,
      put out her hand to take it, he recognised her as too obliging to the
      young man who had preceded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve too much to carry,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you must let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My husband always forgets
      something. He can do nothing without his umbrella. He is d&rsquo;une etourderie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must allow me to carry the umbrella,&rdquo; Longmore risked; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s too
      much of it for a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assented, after many compliments to his politeness; and he walked by
      her side into the meadow. She went lightly and rapidly, picking her steps
      and glancing forward to catch a glimpse of her husband. She was graceful,
      she was charming, she had an air of decision and yet of accommodation, and
      it seemed to our friend that a young artist would work none the worse for
      having her seated at his side reading Chenier&rsquo;s iambics. They were newly
      married, he supposed, and evidently their path of life had none of the
      mocking crookedness of some others. They asked little; but what need to
      ask more than such quiet summer days by a shady stream, with a comrade all
      amiability, to say nothing of art and books and a wide unmenaced horizon?
      To spend such a morning, to stroll back to dinner in the red-tiled parlour
      of the inn, to ramble away again as the sun got low&mdash;all this was a
      vision of delight which floated before him only to torture him with a
      sense of the impossible. All Frenchwomen were not coquettes, he noted as
      he kept pace with his companion. She uttered a word now and then for
      politeness&rsquo; sake, but she never looked at him and seemed not in the least
      to care that he was a well-favoured and well-dressed young man. She cared
      for nothing but the young artist in the shabby coat and the slouched hat,
      and for discovering where he had set up his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was soon done. He was encamped under the trees, close to the stream,
      and, in the diffused green shade of the little wood, couldn&rsquo;t have felt
      immediate need of his umbrella. He received a free rebuke, however, for
      forgetting it, and was informed of what he owed to Longmore&rsquo;s
      complaisance. He was duly grateful; he thanked our hero warmly and offered
      him a seat on the grass. But Longmore felt himself a marplot and lingered
      only long enough to glance at the young man&rsquo;s sketch and to see in it an
      easy rendering of the silvery stream and the vivid green rushes. The young
      wife had spread her shawl on the grass at the base of a tree and meant to
      seat herself when he had left them, meant to murmur Chenier&rsquo;s verses to
      the music of the gurgling river. Longmore looked a while from one of these
      lucky persons to the other, barely stifled a sigh, bade them good-morning
      and took his departure. He knew neither where to go nor what to do; he
      seemed afloat on the sea of ineffectual longing. He strolled slowly back
      to the inn, where, in the doorway, he met the landlady returning from the
      butcher&rsquo;s with the lambchops for the dinner of her lodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has made the acquaintance of the dame of our young painter,&rdquo; she
      said with a free smile&mdash;a smile too free for malicious meanings.
      &ldquo;Monsieur has perhaps seen the young man&rsquo;s picture. It appears that he&rsquo;s
      d&rsquo;une jolie force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His picture&rsquo;s very charming,&rdquo; said Longmore, &ldquo;but his dame is more
      charming still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very nice little woman; but I pity her all the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she&rsquo;s to be pitied,&rdquo; Longmore pleaded. &ldquo;They seem a very
      happy couple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlady gave a knowing nod. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust to it, monsieur! Those
      artists&mdash;ca na pas de principes! From one day to another he can plant
      her there! I know them, allez. I&rsquo;ve had them here very often; one year
      with one, another year with another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore was at first puzzled. Then, &ldquo;You mean she&rsquo;s not his wife?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it responsibly. &ldquo;What shall I tell you? They&rsquo;re not des hommes
      serieux, those gentlemen! They don&rsquo;t engage for eternity. It&rsquo;s none of my
      business, and I&rsquo;ve no wish to speak ill of madame. She&rsquo;s gentille&mdash;but
      gentille, and she loves her jeune homme to distraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who then is so distinguished a young woman?&rdquo; asked Longmore. &ldquo;What do you
      know about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing for certain; but it&rsquo;s my belief that she&rsquo;s better than he. I&rsquo;ve
      even gone so far as to believe that she&rsquo;s a lady&mdash;a vraie dame&mdash;and
      that she has given up a great many things for him. I do the best I can for
      them, but I don&rsquo;t believe she has had all her life to put up with a dinner
      of two courses.&rdquo; And she turned over her lamb-chops tenderly, as to say
      that though a good cook could imagine better things, yet if you could have
      but one course lamb-chops had much in their favour. &ldquo;I shall do them with
      breadcrumbs. Voila les femmes, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore turned away with the feeling that women were indeed a measureless
      mystery, and that it was hard to say in which of their forms of perversity
      there was most merit. He walked back to Saint-Germain more slowly than he
      had come, with less philosophic resignation to any event and more of the
      urgent egotism of the passion pronounced by philosophers the supremely
      selfish one. Now and then the episode of the happy young painter and the
      charming woman who had given up a great many things for him rose vividly
      in his mind and seemed to mock his moral unrest like some obtrusive vision
      of unattainable bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady&rsquo;s gossip had cast no shadow on its brightness; her voice
      seemed that of the vulgar chorus of the uninitiated, which stands always
      ready with its gross prose rendering of the inspired passages of human
      action. Was it possible a man could take THAT from a woman&mdash;take all
      that lent lightness to that other woman&rsquo;s footstep and grace to her
      surrender and not give her the absolute certainty of a devotion as
      unalterable as the process of the sun? Was it possible that so clear a
      harmony had the seeds of trouble, that the charm of so perfect union could
      be broken by anything but death? Longmore felt an immense desire to cry
      out a thousand times &ldquo;No!&rdquo; for it seemed to him at last that he was
      somehow only a graver equivalent of the young lover and that rustling
      Claudine was a lighter sketch of Madame de Mauves. The heat of the sun, as
      he walked along, became oppressive, and when he re-entered the forest he
      turned aside into the deepest shade he could find and stretched himself on
      the mossy ground at the foot of a great beech. He lay for a while staring
      up into the verdurous dusk overhead and trying mentally to see his friend
      at Saint-Germain hurry toward some quiet stream-side where HE waited, as
      he had seen that trusting creature hurry an hour before. It would be hard
      to say how well he succeeded; but the effort soothed rather than excited
      him, and as he had had a good deal both of moral and physical fatigue he
      sank at last into a quiet sleep. While he slept moreover he had a strange
      and vivid dream. He seemed to be in a wood, very much like the one on
      which his eyes had lately closed; but the wood was divided by the
      murmuring stream he had left an hour before. He was walking up and down,
      he thought, restlessly and in intense expectation of some momentous event.
      Suddenly, at a distance, through the trees, he saw a gleam of a woman&rsquo;s
      dress, on which he hastened to meet her. As he advanced he recognised her,
      but he saw at the same time that she was on the other bank of the river.
      She seemed at first not to notice him, but when they had come to opposite
      places she stopped and looked at him very gravely and pityingly. She made
      him no sign that he must cross the stream, but he wished unutterably to
      stand by her side. He knew the water was deep, and it seemed to him he
      knew how he should have to breast it and how he feared that when he rose
      to the surface she would have disappeared. Nevertheless he was going to
      plunge when a boat turned into the current from above and came swiftly
      toward them, guided by an oarsman who was sitting so that they couldn&rsquo;t
      see his face. He brought the boat to the bank where Longmore stood; the
      latter stepped in, and with a few strokes they touched the opposite shore.
      Longmore got out and, though he was sure he had crossed the stream, Madame
      de Mauves was not there. He turned with a kind of agony and saw that now
      she was on the other bank&mdash;the one he had left. She gave him a grave
      silent glance and walked away up the stream. The boat and the boatman
      resumed their course, but after going a short distance they stopped and
      the boatman turned back and looked at the still divided couple. Then
      Longmore recognised him&mdash;just as he had recognised him a few days
      before at the restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      He must have slept some time after he ceased dreaming for he had no
      immediate memory of this vision. It came back to him later, after he had
      roused himself and had walked nearly home. No great arrangement was needed
      to make it seem a striking allegory, and it haunted and oppressed him for
      the rest of the day. He took refuge, however, in his quickened conviction
      that the only sound policy in life is to grasp unsparingly at happiness;
      and it seemed no more than one of the vigorous measures dictated by such a
      policy to return that evening to Madame de Mauves. And yet when he had
      decided to do so and had carefully dressed himself he felt an irresistible
      nervous tremor which made it easier to linger at his open window,
      wondering with a strange mixture of dread and desire whether Madame
      Clairin had repeated to her sister-in-law what she had said to him. His
      presence now might be simply a gratuitous annoyance, and yet his absence
      might seem to imply that it was in the power of circumstances to make them
      ashamed to meet each other&rsquo;s eyes. He sat a long time with his head in his
      hands, lost in a painful confusion of hopes and ambiguities. He felt at
      moments as if he could throttle Madame Clairin, and yet couldn&rsquo;t help
      asking himself if it weren&rsquo;t possible she had done him a service. It was
      late when he left the hotel, and as he entered the gate of the other house
      his heart beat so fast that he was sure his voice would show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant ushered him into the drawing-room, which was empty and with
      the lamp burning low. But the long windows were open and their light
      curtains swaying in a soft warm wind, so that Longmore immediately stepped
      out upon the terrace. There he found Madame de Mauves alone, slowly pacing
      its length. She was dressed in white, very simply, and her hair was
      arranged not as she usually wore it, but in a single loose coil and as if
      she were unprepared for company. She stopped when she saw her friend,
      showed some surprise, uttered an exclamation and stood waiting for him to
      speak. He tried, with his eyes on her, to say something, but found no
      words. He knew it was awkward, it was offensive, to stand gazing at her;
      but he couldn&rsquo;t say what was suitable and mightn&rsquo;t say what he wished. Her
      face was indistinct in the dim light, but he felt her eyes fixed on him
      and wondered what they expressed. Did they warn him, did they plead, or
      did they confess to a sense of provocation? For an instant his head swam;
      he was sure it would make all things clear to stride forward and fold her
      in his arms. But a moment later he was still dumb there before her; he
      hadn&rsquo;t moved; he knew she had spoken, but he hadn&rsquo;t understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were here this morning,&rdquo; she continued; and now, slowly, the meaning
      of her words came to him. &ldquo;I had a bad headache and had to shut myself
      up.&rdquo; She spoke with her usual voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore mastered his agitation and answered her without betraying
      himself. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, I&rsquo;m better&mdash;much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited again and she moved away to a chair and seated herself. After a
      pause he followed her and leaned closer to her, against the balustrade of
      the terrace. &ldquo;I hoped you might have been able to come out for the morning
      into the forest. I went alone; it was a lovely day, and I took a long
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a lovely day,&rdquo; she said absently, and sat with her eyes lowered,
      slowly opening and closing her fan. Longmore, as he watched her, felt more
      and more assured her sister-in-law had seen her since her interview with
      him; that her attitude toward him was changed. It was this same something
      that hampered the desire with which he had come, or at least converted all
      his imagined freedom of speech about it to a final hush of wonder. No,
      certainly, he couldn&rsquo;t clasp her to his arms now, any more than some
      antique worshipper could have clasped the marble statue in his temple. But
      Longmore&rsquo;s statue spoke at last with a full human voice and even with a
      shade of human hesitation. She looked up, and it seemed to him her eyes
      shone through the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you came this evening&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve a particular reason
      for being glad. I half-expected you, and yet I thought it possible you
      mightn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the case has been present to me,&rdquo; Longmore answered, &ldquo;it was
      impossible I shouldn&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve spent every minute of the day in
      thinking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no immediate reply, but continued to open and close her fan
      thoughtfully. At last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something important to say to you,&rdquo; she
      resumed with decision. &ldquo;I want you to know to a certainty that I&rsquo;ve a very
      high opinion of you.&rdquo; Longmore gave an uneasy shift to his position. To
      what was she coming? But he said nothing, and she went on: &ldquo;I take a great
      interest in you. There&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t say it. I feel a great
      friendship for you.&rdquo; He began to laugh, all awkwardly&mdash;he hardly knew
      why, unless because this seemed the very irony of detachment. But she went
      on in her way: &ldquo;You know, I suppose, that a great disappointment always
      implies a great confidence&mdash;a great hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve certainly hoped,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hoped strongly; but doubtless never
      rationally enough to have a right to bemoan my disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something troubled in her face that seemed all the while to burn
      clearer. &ldquo;You do yourself injustice. I&rsquo;ve such confidence in your fairness
      of mind that I should be greatly disappointed if I were to find it
      wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really almost believe you&rsquo;re amusing yourself at my expense,&rdquo; the young
      man cried. &ldquo;My fairness of mind? Of all the question-begging terms!&rdquo; he
      laughed. &ldquo;The only thing for one&rsquo;s mind to be fair to is the thing one
      FEELS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet and looked at him hard. His eyes by this time were
      accustomed to the imperfect light, and he could see that if she was urgent
      she was yet beseechingly kind. She shook her head impatiently and came
      near enough to lay her fan on his arm with a strong pressure. &ldquo;If that
      were so it would be a weary world. I know enough, however, of your
      probable attitude. You needn&rsquo;t try to express it. It&rsquo;s enough that your
      sincerity gives me the right to ask a favour of you&mdash;to make an
      intense, a solemn request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it; I listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T DISAPPOINT ME. If you don&rsquo;t understand me now you will to-morrow or
      very soon. When I said just now that I had a high opinion of you, you see
      I meant it very seriously,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a vain compliment. I
      believe there&rsquo;s no appeal one may make to your generosity that can remain
      long unanswered. If this were to happen&mdash;if I were to find you
      selfish where I thought you generous, narrow where I thought you large&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she spoke slowly, her voice lingering with all emphasis on each of these
      words&mdash;&ldquo;vulgar where I thought you rare, I should think worse of
      human nature. I should take it, I assure you, very hard indeed. I should
      say to myself in the dull days of the future: &lsquo;There was ONE man who might
      have done so and so, and he too failed.&rsquo; But this shan&rsquo;t be. You&rsquo;ve made
      too good an impression on me not to make the very best. If you wish to
      please me for ever there&rsquo;s a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing close to him, with her dress touching him, her eyes fixed
      on his. As she went on her tone became, to his sense, extraordinary, and
      she offered the odd spectacle of a beautiful woman preaching reason with
      the most communicative and irresistible passion. Longmore was dazzled, but
      mystified and bewildered. The intention of her words was all remonstrance,
      refusal, dismissal, but her presence and effect there, so close, so
      urgent, so personal, a distracting contradiction of it. She had never been
      so lovely. In her white dress, with her pale face and deeply-lighted brow,
      she seemed the very spirit of the summer night. When she had ceased
      speaking she drew a long breath; he felt it on his cheek, and it stirred
      in his whole being a sudden perverse imagination. Were not her words, in
      their high impossible rigour, a mere challenge to his sincerity, a mere
      precaution of her pride, meant to throw into relief her almost ghostly
      beauty, and wasn&rsquo;t this the only truth, the only law, the only thing to
      take account of?
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and felt her watch him not without pain and perplexity
      herself. He looked at her again, met her own eyes and saw them fill with
      strange tears. Then this last sophistry of his great desire for her knew
      itself touched as a bubble is pricked; it died away with a stifled murmur,
      and her beauty, more and more radiant in the darkness, rose before him as
      a symbol of something vague which was yet more beautiful than itself. &ldquo;I
      may understand you to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I took counsel with myself to-day and asked myself how I had best
      speak to you. On one side I might have refused to see you at all.&rdquo;
       Longmore made a violent movement, and she added: &ldquo;In that case I should
      have written to you. I might see you, I thought, and simply say to you
      that there were excellent reasons why we should part, and that I begged
      this visit should be your last. This I inclined to do; what made me decide
      otherwise was&mdash;well, simply that I like you so. I said to myself that
      I should be glad to remember in future days, not that I had, in the
      horrible phrase, got rid of you, but that you had gone away out of the
      fulness of your own wisdom and the excellence of your own taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah wisdom and taste!&rdquo; the poor young man wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared, if necessary,&rdquo; Madame de Mauves continued after a pause,
      &ldquo;to fall back on my strict right. But, as I said before, I shall be
      greatly disappointed if I&rsquo;m obliged to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I listen to your horrible and unnatural lucidity,&rdquo; Longmore
      answered, &ldquo;I feel so angry, so merely sore and sick, that I wonder I don&rsquo;t
      leave you without more words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should go away in anger this idea of mine about our parting would
      be but half-realised,&rdquo; she returned with no drop in her ardour. &ldquo;No, I
      don&rsquo;t want to think of you as feeling a great pain, I don&rsquo;t want even to
      think of you as making a great sacrifice. I want to think of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a stupid brute who has never existed, who never CAN exist!&rdquo; he broke
      in. &ldquo;A creature who could know you without loving you, who could leave you
      without for ever missing you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned impatiently away and walked to the other end of the terrace.
      When she came back he saw that her impatience had grown sharp and almost
      hard. She stood before him again, looking at him from head to foot and
      without consideration now; so that as the effect of it he felt his
      assurance finally quite sink. This then she took from him, withholding in
      consequence something she had meant to say. She moved off afresh, walked
      to the other end of the terrace and stood there with her face to the
      garden. She assumed that he understood her, and slowly, slowly, half as
      the fruit of this mute pressure, he let everything go but the rage of a
      purpose somehow still to please her. She was giving him a chance to do
      gallantly what it seemed unworthy of both of them he should do meanly. She
      must have &ldquo;liked&rdquo; him indeed, as she said, to wish so to spare him, to go
      to the trouble of conceiving an ideal of conduct for him. With this sense
      of her tenderness still in her dreadful consistency, his spirit rose with
      a new flight and suddenly felt itself breathe clearer air. Her profession
      ceased to seem a mere bribe to his eagerness; it was charged with
      eagerness itself; it was a present reward and would somehow last. He moved
      rapidly toward her as with the sense of a gage that he might sublimely yet
      immediately enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were separated by two thirds of the length of the terrace, and he had
      to pass the drawing-room window. As he did so he started with an
      exclamation. Madame Clairin stood framed in the opening as if, though just
      arriving on the scene, she too were already aware of its interest.
      Conscious, apparently, that she might be suspected of having watched them
      she stepped forward with a smile and looked from one to the other. &ldquo;Such a
      tete-a-tete as that one owes no apology for interrupting. One ought to
      come in for good manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Mauves turned to her, but answered nothing. She looked straight
      at Longmore, and her eyes shone with a lustre that struck him as divine.
      He was not exactly sure indeed what she meant them to say, but it
      translated itself to something that would do. &ldquo;Call it what you will, what
      you&rsquo;ve wanted to urge upon me is the thing this woman can best conceive.
      What I ask of you is something she can&rsquo;t begin to!&rdquo; They seemed somehow to
      beg him to suffer her to be triumphantly herself, and to intimate&mdash;yet
      this too all decently&mdash;how little that self was of Madame Clairin&rsquo;s
      particular swelling measure. He felt an immense answering desire not to do
      anything then that might seem probable or prevu to this lady. He had laid
      his hat and stick on the parapet of the terrace. He took them up, offered
      his hand to Madame de Mauves with a simple good-night, bowed silently to
      Madame Clairin and found his way, with tingling ears, out of the place.

    <p>
      He went home and, without lighting his candle, flung himself on his bed.
      But he got no sleep till morning; he lay hour after hour tossing,
      thinking, wondering; his mind had never been so active. It seemed to him
      his friend had laid on him in those last moments a heavy charge and had
      expressed herself almost as handsomely as if she had listened complacently
      to an assurance of his love. It was neither easy nor delightful thoroughly
      to understand her; but little by little her perfect meaning sank into his
      mind and soothed it with a sense of opportunity which somehow stifled his
      sense of loss. For, to begin with, she meant that she could love him in no
      degree or contingency, in no imaginable future. This was absolute&mdash;he
      knew he could no more alter it than he could pull down one of the
      constellations he lay gazing at through his open window. He wondered to
      what it was, in the background of her life, she had so dedicated herself.
      A conception of duty unquenchable to the end? A love that no outrage could
      stifle? &ldquo;Great heaven!&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;is the world so rich in the purest
      pearls of passion that such tenderness as that can be wasted for ever&mdash;poured
      away without a sigh into bottomless darkness?&rdquo; Had she, in spite of the
      detestable present, some precious memory that still kept the door of
      possibility open? Was she prepared to submit to everything and yet to
      believe? Was it strength, was it weakness, was it a vulgar fear, was it
      conviction, conscience, constancy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore sank back with a sigh and an oppressive feeling that it was vain
      to guess at such a woman&rsquo;s motives. He only felt that those of this one
      were buried deep in her soul and that they must be of the noblest, must
      contain nothing base. He had his hard impression that endless constancy
      was all her law&mdash;a constancy that still found a foothold among
      crumbling ruins. &ldquo;She has loved once,&rdquo; he said to himself as he rose and
      wandered to his window; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s for ever. Yes, yes&mdash;if she loved
      again she&rsquo;d be COMMON!&rdquo; He stood for a long time looking out into the
      starlit silence of the town and forest and thinking of what life would
      have been if his constancy had met her own in earlier days. But life was
      this now, and he must live. It was living, really, to stand there with
      such a faith even in one&rsquo;s self still flung over one by such hands. He was
      not to disappoint her, he was to justify a conception it had beguiled her
      weariness to form. His imagination embraced it; he threw back his head and
      seemed to be looking for his friend&rsquo;s conception among the blinking
      mocking stars. But it came to him rather on the mild night-wind wandering
      in over the house-tops which covered the rest of so many heavy human
      hearts. What she asked he seemed to feel her ask not for her own sake&mdash;she
      feared nothing, she needed nothing&mdash;but for that of his own happiness
      and his own character. He must assent to destiny. Why else was he young
      and strong, intelligent and resolute? He mustn&rsquo;t give it to her to
      reproach him with thinking she had had a moment&rsquo;s attention for his love,
      give it to her to plead, to argue, to break off in bitterness. He must see
      everything from above, her indifference and his own ardour; he must prove
      his strength, must do the handsome thing, must decide that the handsome
      thing was to submit to the inevitable, to be supremely delicate, to spare
      her all pain, to stifle his passion, to ask no compensation, to depart
      without waiting and to try to believe that wisdom is its own reward. All
      this, neither more nor less, it was a matter of beautiful friendship with
      him for her to expect of him. And what should he himself gain by it? He
      should have pleased her! Well, he flung himself on his bed again, fell
      asleep at last and slept till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before noon next day he had made up his mind to leave Saint-Germain at
      once. It seemed easiest to go without seeing her, and yet if he might ask
      for a grain of &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; this would be five minutes face to face with
      her. He passed a restless day. Wherever he went he saw her stand before
      him in the dusky halo of evening, saw her look at him with an air of still
      negation more intoxicating than the most passionate self-surrender. He
      must certainly go, and yet it was hideously hard. He compromised and went
      to Paris to spend the rest of the day. He strolled along the boulevard and
      paused sightlessly before the shops, sat a while in the Tuileries gardens
      and looked at the shabby unfortunates for whom this only was nature and
      summer; but simply felt afresh, as a result of it all, the dusty dreary
      lonely world to which Madame de Mauves had consigned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sombre mood he made his way back to the centre of motion and sat down
      at a table before a cafe door, on the great plain of hot asphalt. Night
      arrived, the lamps were lighted, the tables near him found occupants, and
      Paris began to wear that evening grimace of hers that seems to tell, in
      the flare of plate glass and of theatre-doors, the muffled rumble of
      swift-rolling carriages, how this is no world for you unless you have your
      pockets lined and your delicacies perverted. Longmore, however, had
      neither scruples nor desires; he looked at the great preoccupied place for
      the first time with an easy sense of repaying its indifference. Before
      long a carriage drove up to the pavement directly in front of him and
      remained standing for several minutes without sign from its occupant. It
      was one of those neat plain coupes, drawn by a single powerful horse, in
      which the flaneur figures a pale handsome woman buried among silk cushions
      and yawning as she sees the gas-lamps glittering in the gutters. At last
      the door opened and out stepped Richard de Mauves. He stopped and leaned
      on the window for some time, talking in an excited manner to a person
      within. At last he gave a nod and the carriage rolled away. He stood
      swinging his cane and looking up and down the boulevard, with the air of a
      man fumbling, as one might say, the loose change of time. He turned toward
      the cafe and was apparently, for want of anything better worth his
      attention, about to seat himself at one of the tables when he noticed
      Longmore. He wavered an instant and then, without a shade of difference in
      his careless gait, advanced to the accompaniment of a thin recognition. It
      was the first time they had met since their encounter in the forest after
      Longmore&rsquo;s false start for Brussels. Madame Clairin&rsquo;s revelations, as he
      might have regarded them, had not made the Count especially present to his
      mind; he had had another call to meet than the call of disgust. But now,
      as M. de Mauves came toward him he felt abhorrence well up. He made out,
      however, for the first time, a cloud on this nobleman&rsquo;s superior
      clearness, and a delight at finding the shoe somewhere at last pinching
      HIM, mingled with the resolve to be blank and unaccommodating, enabled him
      to meet the occasion with due promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves sat down, and the two men looked at each other across the
      table, exchanging formal remarks that did little to lend grace to their
      encounter. Longmore had no reason to suppose the Count knew of his
      sister&rsquo;s various interventions. He was sure M. de Mauves cared very little
      about his opinions, and yet he had a sense of something grim in his own
      New York face which would have made him change colour if keener suspicion
      had helped it to be read there. M. de Mauves didn&rsquo;t change colour, but he
      looked at his wife&rsquo;s so oddly, so more than naturally (wouldn&rsquo;t it be?)
      detached friend with an intentness that betrayed at once an irritating
      memory of the episode in the Bois de Boulogne and such vigilant curiosity
      as was natural to a gentleman who had entrusted his &ldquo;honour&rdquo; to another
      gentleman&rsquo;s magnanimity&mdash;or to his artlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might appear that these virtues shone out of our young man less
      engagingly or reassuringly than a few days before; the shadow at any rate
      fell darker across the brow of his critic, who turned away and frowned
      while lighting a cigar. The person in the coupe, he accordingly judged,
      whether or no the same person as the heroine of the episode of the Bois de
      Boulogne, was not a source of unalloyed delight. Longmore had dark blue
      eyes of admirable clarity, settled truth-telling eyes which had in his
      childhood always made his harshest taskmasters smile at his notion of a
      subterfuge. An observer watching the two men and knowing something of
      their relations would certainly have said that what he had at last both to
      recognise and to miss in those eyes must not a little have puzzled and
      tormented M. de Mauves. They took possession of him, they laid him out,
      they measured him in that state of flatness, they triumphed over him, they
      treated him as no pair of eyes had perhaps ever treated any member of his
      family before. The Count&rsquo;s scheme had been to provide for a positive state
      of ease on the part of no one save himself, but here was Longmore already,
      if appearances perhaps not appreciable to the vulgar meant anything,
      primed as for some prospect of pleasure more than Parisian. Was this
      candid young barbarian but a faux bonhomme after all? He had never really
      quite satisfied his occasional host, but was he now, for a climax, to
      leave him almost gaping?
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves, as if hating to seem preoccupied, took up the evening paper
      to help himself to seem indifferent. As he glanced over it he threw off
      some perfunctory allusion to the crisis&mdash;the political&mdash;which
      enabled Longmore to reply with perfect veracity that, with other things to
      think about, he had had no attention to spare for it. And yet our hero was
      in truth far from secure against rueful reflexion. The Count&rsquo;s ruffled
      state was a comfort so far as it pointed to the possibility that the lady
      in the coupe might be proving too many for him; but it ministered to no
      vindictive sweetness for Longmore so far as it should perhaps represent
      rising jealousy. It passed through his mind that jealousy is a passion
      with a double face and that on one of its sides it may sometimes almost
      look generous. It glimmered upon him odiously M. de Mauves might grow
      ashamed of his political compact with his wife, and he felt how far more
      tolerable it would be in future to think of him as always impertinent than
      to think of him as occasionally contrite. The two men pretended meanwhile
      for half an hour to outsit each other conveniently; and the end&mdash;at
      that rate&mdash;might have been distant had not the tension in some degree
      yielded to the arrival of a friend of M. de Mauves&mdash;a tall pale
      consumptive-looking dandy who filled the air with the odour of heliotrope.
      He looked up and down the boulevard wearily, examined the Count&rsquo;s garments
      in some detail, then appeared to refer restlessly to his own, and at last
      announced resignedly that the Duchess was in town. M. de Mauves must come
      with him to call; she had abused him dreadfully a couple of evenings
      before&mdash;a sure sign she wanted to see him. &ldquo;I depend on you,&rdquo; said
      with an infantine drawl this specimen of an order Longmore felt he had
      never had occasion so intimately to appreciate, &ldquo;to put her en train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves resisted, he protested that he was d&rsquo;une humeur massacrante;
      but at last he allowed himself to be drawn to his feet and stood looking
      awkwardly&mdash;awkwardly for M. de Mauves&mdash;at Longmore. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      excuse me,&rdquo; he appeared to find some difficulty in saying; &ldquo;you too
      probably have occupation for the evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None but to catch my train.&rdquo; And our friend looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah you go back to Saint-Germain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves seemed on the point of disengaging himself from his
      companion&rsquo;s arm, which was locked in his own; but on the latter&rsquo;s uttering
      some persuasive murmur he lifted his hat stiffly and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore the next day wandered off to the terrace to try and beguile the
      restlessness with which he waited for the evening; he wished to see Madame
      de Mauves for the last time at the hour of long shadows and pale reflected
      amber lights, as he had almost always seen her. Destiny, however, took no
      account of this humble plea for poetic justice; it was appointed him to
      meet her seated by the great walk under a tree and alone. The hour made
      the place almost empty; the day was warm, but as he took his place beside
      her a light breeze stirred the leafy edges of their broad circle of
      shadow. She looked at him almost with no pretence of not having believed
      herself already rid of him, and he at once told her that he should leave
      Saint-Germain that evening, but must first bid her farewell. Her face
      lighted a moment, he fancied, as he spoke; but she said nothing, only
      turning it off to far Paris which lay twinkling and flashing through hot
      exhalations. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a request to make of you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That you think of
      me as a man who has felt much and claimed little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath which almost suggested pain. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of you
      as unhappy. That&rsquo;s impossible. You&rsquo;ve a life to lead, you&rsquo;ve duties,
      talents, inspirations, interests. I shall hear of your career. And then,&rdquo;
       she pursued after a pause, though as if it had before this quite been
      settled between them, &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t be unhappy through having a better
      opinion of a friend instead of a worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he failed to understand her. &ldquo;Do you mean that there can be
      varying degrees in my opinion of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and pushed away her chair. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
      better to have done nothing in bitterness&mdash;nothing in passion.&rdquo; And
      she began to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore followed her without answering at first. But he took off his hat
      and with his pocket-handkerchief wiped his forehead. &ldquo;Where shall you go?
      what shall you do?&rdquo; he simply asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? I shall do as I&rsquo;ve always done&mdash;except perhaps that I shall go
      for a while to my husband&rsquo;s old home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go to MY old one. I&rsquo;ve done with Europe for the present,&rdquo; the
      young man added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him as he walked beside her, after he had spoken these
      words, and then bent her eyes for a long time on the ground. But suddenly,
      as if aware of her going too far she stopped and put out her hand.
      &ldquo;Good-bye. May you have all the happiness you deserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand with his eyes on her, but something was at work in him
      that made it impossible to deal in the easy way with her touch. Something
      of infinite value was floating past him, and he had taken an oath, with
      which any such case interfered, not to raise a finger to stop it. It was
      borne by the strong current of the world&rsquo;s great life and not of his own
      small one. Madame de Mauves disengaged herself, gathered in her long scarf
      and smiled at him almost as you would do at a child you should wish to
      encourage. Several moments later he was still there watching her leave him
      and leave him. When she was out of sight he shook himself, walked at once
      back to his hotel and, without waiting for the evening train, paid his
      bill and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day M. de Mauves came into his wife&rsquo;s drawing-room, where she
      sat waiting to be summoned to dinner. He had dressed as he usually didn&rsquo;t
      dress for dining at home. He walked up and down for some moments in
      silence, then rang the bell for a servant and went out into the hall to
      meet him. He ordered the carriage to take him to the station, paused a
      moment with his hand on the knob of the door, dismissed the servant
      angrily as the latter lingered observing him, re-entered the drawing-room,
      resumed his restless walk and at last stopped abruptly before his wife,
      who had taken up a book. &ldquo;May I ask the favour,&rdquo; he said with evident
      effort, in spite of a forced smile as of allusion to a large past exercise
      of the very best taste, &ldquo;of having a question answered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a favour I never refused,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true. Do you expect this evening a visit from Mr. Longmore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Longmore,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;has left Saint-Germain.&rdquo; M. de Mauves
      waited, but his smile expired. &ldquo;Mr. Longmore,&rdquo; his wife continued, &ldquo;has
      gone to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Mauves took it&mdash;a rare thing for him&mdash;with confessed, if
      momentary, intellectual indigence. But he raised, as it were, the wind.
      &ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Had he a sudden call?&rdquo; But his
      question received no answer. At the same moment the servant threw open the
      door and announced dinner; Madame Clairin rustled in, rubbing her white
      hands, Madame de Mauves passed silently into the dining-room, but he
      remained outside&mdash;outside of more things, clearly, than his mere
      salle-a-manger. Before long he went forth to the terrace and continued his
      uneasy walk. At the end of a quarter of an hour the servant came to let
      him know that his carriage was at the door. &ldquo;Send it away,&rdquo; he said
      without hesitation. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t use it.&rdquo; When the ladies had half-finished
      dinner he returned and joined them, with a formal apology to his wife for
      his inconsequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dishes were brought back, but he hardly tasted them; he drank on the
      other hand more wine than usual. There was little talk, scarcely a
      convivial sound save the occasional expressive appreciative &ldquo;M-m-m!&rdquo; of
      Madame Clairin over the succulence of some dish. Twice this lady saw her
      brother&rsquo;s eyes, fixed on her own over his wineglass, put to her a question
      she knew she should have to irritate him later on by not being able to
      answer. She replied, for the present at least, by an elevation of the
      eyebrows that resembled even to her own humour the vain raising of an
      umbrella in anticipation of a storm. M. de Mauves was left alone to finish
      his wine; he sat over it for more than an hour and let the darkness gather
      about him. At last the servant came in with a letter and lighted a candle.
      The letter was a telegram, which M. de Mauves, when he had read it, burnt
      at the candle. After five minutes&rsquo; meditation he wrote a message on the
      back of a visiting-card and gave it to the servant to carry to the office.
      The man knew quite as much as his master suspected about the lady to whom
      the telegram was addressed; but its contents puzzled him; they consisted
      of the single word &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo; As the evening passed without her
      brother&rsquo;s reappearing in the drawing-room Madame Clairin came to him where
      he sat by his solitary candle. He took no notice of her presence for some
      time, but this affected her as unexpected indulgence. At last, however, he
      spoke with a particular harshness. &ldquo;Ce jeune mufle has gone home at an
      hour&rsquo;s notice. What the devil does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clairin now felt thankful for her umbrella. &ldquo;It means that I&rsquo;ve a
      sister-in-law whom I&rsquo;ve not the honour to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing more and silently allowed her, after a little, to depart.
      It had been her duty to provide him with an explanation, and he was
      disgusted with her blankness; but she was&mdash;if there was no more to
      come&mdash;getting off easily. When she had gone he went into the garden
      and walked up and down with his cigar. He saw his wife seated alone on the
      terrace, but remained below, wandering, turning, pausing, lingering. He
      remained a long time. It grew late and Madame de Mauves disappeared.
      Toward midnight he dropped upon a bench, tired, with a long vague
      exhalation of unrest. It was sinking into his spirit that he too didn&rsquo;t
      understand Madame Clairin&rsquo;s sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longmore was obliged to wait a week in London for a ship. It was very hot,
      and he went out one day to Richmond. In the garden of the hotel at which
      he dined he met his friend Mrs. Draper, who was staying there. She made
      eager enquiry about Madame de Mauves; but Longmore at first, as they sat
      looking out at the famous view of the Thames, parried her questions and
      confined himself to other topics. At last she said she was afraid he had
      something to conceal; whereupon, after a pause, he asked her if she
      remembered recommending him, in the letter she had addressed him at
      Saint-Germain, to draw the sadness from her friend&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;The last I
      saw of her was her smile,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;when I bade her good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember urging you to &lsquo;console&rsquo; her,&rdquo; Mrs. Draper returned, &ldquo;and I
      wondered afterwards whether&mdash;model of discretion as you are&mdash;I
      hadn&rsquo;t cut you out work for which you wouldn&rsquo;t thank me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has her consolation in herself,&rdquo; the young man said; &ldquo;she needs none
      that any one else can offer her. That&rsquo;s for troubles for which&mdash;be it
      more, be it less&mdash;our own folly has to answer. Madame de Mauves
      hasn&rsquo;t a grain of folly left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Draper knowingly protested. &ldquo;Just a little
      folly&rsquo;s often very graceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore rose to go&mdash;she somehow annoyed him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of grace,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;till you&rsquo;ve measured her reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two years after his return to America he heard nothing of Madame de
      Mauves. That he thought of her intently, constantly, I need hardly say;
      most people wondered why such a clever young man shouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;devote&rdquo;
       himself to something; but to himself he seemed absorbingly occupied. He
      never wrote to her; he believed she wouldn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;liked&rdquo; it. At last he
      heard that Mrs. Draper had come home and he immediately called on her. &ldquo;Of
      course,&rdquo; she said after the first greetings, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re dying for news of
      Madame de Mauves. Prepare yourself for something strange. I heard from her
      two or three times during the year after your seeing her. She left
      Saint-Germain and went to live in the country on some old property of her
      husband&rsquo;s. She wrote me very kind little notes, but I felt somehow that&mdash;in
      spite of what you said about &lsquo;consolation&rsquo;&mdash;they were the notes of a
      wretched woman. The only advice I could have given her was to leave her
      scamp of a husband and come back to her own land and her own people. But
      this I didn&rsquo;t feel free to do, and yet it made me so miserable not to be
      able to help her that I preferred to let our correspondence die a natural
      death. I had no news of her for a year. Last summer, however, I met at
      Vichy a clever young Frenchman whom I accidentally learned to be a friend
      of that charming sister of the Count&rsquo;s, Madame Clairin. I lost no time in
      asking him what he knew about Madame de Mauves&mdash;a countrywoman of
      mine and an old friend. &lsquo;I congratulate you on the friendship of such a
      person,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the terrible little woman who killed her
      husband.&rsquo; You may imagine I promptly asked for an explanation, and he told
      me&mdash;from his point of view&mdash;what he called the whole story. M.
      de Mauves had fait quelques folies which his wife had taken absurdly to
      heart. He had repented and asked her forgiveness, which she had inexorably
      refused. She was very pretty, and severity must have suited her style;
      for, whether or no her husband had been in love with her before, he fell
      madly in love with her now. He was the proudest man in France, but he had
      begged her on his knees to be re-admitted to favour. All in vain! She was
      stone, she was ice, she was outraged virtue. People noticed a great change
      in him; he gave up society, ceased to care for anything, looked
      shockingly. One fine day they discovered he had blown out his brains. My
      friend had the story of course from Madame Clairin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Longmore was strongly moved, and his first impulse after he had recovered
      his composure was to return immediately to Europe. But several years have
      passed, and he still lingers at home. The truth is that, in the midst of
      all the ardent tenderness of his memory of Madame de Mauves, he has become
      conscious of a singular feeling&mdash;a feeling of wonder, of uncertainty,
      of awe.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
